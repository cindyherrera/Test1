I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of [Mathematics][2]. There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" />

You can abuse [Fullwidth Dollar Sign (U+FF04)](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/ff04/index.htm).

Do not ask what _someone_ cares about, but ask what _you_ care about.  If _you_ do not care about a question, either no one really cares or those who care can ask a better question.  Posting a question which you do not care about is a waste of time for everyone who reads the question (and possibly tries to answer it).  Put differently: **Do not ask a question for the sake of asking a question**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A corollary of this is: **Try to answer by yourself before posting a question**.  If you really care about a question, the first thing to do should not be posting the question on a website, but trying to solve it by yourself.  This includes looking up literature, formulating it from different angles, considering small cases, special cases and/or variations, and so on; in short, what you normally do to solve a problem.  If you do not want to think about the question by yourself, ask yourself whether you really care about the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This does not mean that you must not ask a question unless you have proved that you cannot answer it by yourself (which is obviously impossible).  However, make some reasonable effort to try to answer your own question before posting it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related guidelines:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Even if you care about the question, the reader may not know it.

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [http://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](http://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.  We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Research-level mathematics — [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * General mathematics — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/); they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor. &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Currently we have two separate lists of FAQs.  See also **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of [Mathematics][2]. There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" />

Down voting a post (answer/question) without commenting is NOT OK, it is against the norm, this is discussed in the last town hall meeting and there seemed to be a consensus among the people attending the meeting. Without a comment the purpose of the down-vote is not clear, it is not a constructive down-vote, and a user answering the question can get confused because he or she might not understand what is wrong with the answer or what behavior is being criticized.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. I don't find down-voting answers just because of answering a question reasonable. If the user answering the question has not done anything unreasonable and the answer is OK it does not deserve a down-vote IMO. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. On the other hand, it might be reasonable to down vote an answer when its poster has done something unreasonable or against the norms, e.g. [answering a question which is clearly homework](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/601/1037) (not just off-topic), it can be reasonable in such situation because the user is violating an agreed norm about not answering homework questions (and note that even in these cases the down-vote should be explained in a comment).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. If an answer is not: a. correct, b. well-written, c. an answer to the question; i.e. it is not a good answer to the question then it is reasonable (and even sometimes encouraged) to down-vote it, (but again, even in these cases the down-vote should be explained in a comment)." />

I don't think we are yet on course to be a successful Q&amp;A site for a few reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. We have no users who I would call names to conjure with.  This matters for any site: e.g., SO has many active users who are highly recognised experts for a large number of topics, and the SX folk think that this is essential to SOs success and will be essential to the sites coming through the SX beta phase. For academic Q&amp;A sites, as opposed to problem-solving sites I think this is even more important.  How important has Terence Tao's endorsement of MO been to that site's success?  The other two beta sites I've participated in, math.SX and tex.SX, had done far better by their 10th day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. We have a lack of high reputation users.  We don't have any 1k+ reputation users at all, so apart from the SX moderators, we have no-one who can edit weak questions, let alone access the moderation tools. It takes five 500+ users to close a question without moderator actions; we have 8.  We have only 23x 250+ users who can retag.  To some extent, this is a fact of life about the early public beta stage, but other sites have done better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Very little interest has been shown, or effort put into in the things that need to be done on meta to make the site a success.  Shane is our distinguished exception, Suresh has put in some effort, as well.  Besides these two, we have a list of fairly undifferentiated potential moderators: I haven't seen a whole lot of indication as to why one 500+ user would make a better moderator than another.  Work on the FAQ is nonexistent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, interesting questions have been asked and answered, we've got a pretty clear idea of our scope, and it's early days.  Call me moderately pessimistic, and since I have discovered that I am suddenly what counts for a high-reputation user around here, I'm going to start making an effort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Postscript**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think we have exactly what I would call &quot;names to conjure with&quot;, but maybe that's too much to expect in TCS, which is much more balkanized that maths, and where the famous names are that much older, and that much less involved in web-based social networking (but, you know, Alan Kay has [an account on SO][2]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, the comments to this post have shown what a breadth there are of scientists who have made indubitably major contributions to the field, and there has been the beginnings of what I hope will be an influx of users have been excellent contributors to MO.  Lance Fornow, in particular, is a young scientist with a high profile.

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni ([meta profile][1], [site profile][2]). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've asked [one question][3], and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack" />

If you think there is nice question hidden inside a question, then you can make suggestions to the OP to improve the question, or ask a new question yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. The opinion at the time was that we are not closing the question too quickly, there is no problem with closing clearly off-topic questions as soon as possible. If later the question is improved to an on-topic question it can be reopened. As you could see from the state of this discussion before your new answer, it was accepted that quickly closing these questions is fine so I am not sure why you expected a change regrading in closing them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ps: next time, please start a new discussion by posting a question in place of posting an answer to an old discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/361#361" />

However, I haven't posted any responses to those questions because I didn't end up with an answer.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of what I've done is discover dead ends and approaches that don't work.  These might be useful for someone to know so that they don't spend time on the same issue or if they'd like to pick up where I left off.  Unfortunately, the Q&amp;A format doesn't seem naturally suited to this style of inquiry.   A wrong answer isn't an &quot;answer&quot; per se, and a detailed discussion won't fit in a non-nested comment thread.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The question: how can the CSTheory Q&amp;A&#xD;&#xA;&gt; format better be used to support these&#xD;&#xA;&gt; kinds of parallel group investigations&#xD;&#xA;&gt; into problems?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One idea is to adopt the convention that &quot;answers&quot; to open questions are to be regarded as a discussion of possible approaches, rather than literal answers or partial answers to the question, then to encourage development of these approaches in the comments.  The downside is that these comments are not nested.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Another possibility is to fork new questions concerning particular avenues of inquiry with links back to the parent question, perhaps with a dedicated &quot;subproblem&quot; tag; this might lead to a messy proliferation of subquestions.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Has any better format been discovered for collaborative investigation of open problems on other StackExchange sites, in particular, MO?  Are there other features in StackExchange we can activate to support this process?  Or is it better to instead restrict these kinds of investigations to blogs and wikis, as was done in Polymath? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]:  https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/144/how-are-we-doing/152#152&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/34/how-hard-is-unshuffling-a-string" />

culture here &amp; sketch something out that can be used as a point for further discussion because its a direction/approach Ive been thinking about &amp; looking into &amp; even veering towards myself &amp; its key to this group. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;this question is probably a little too hypothetical. in principle you could build a paper by stringing together some stackexchange answers but it would be unusual. as mod kaveh writes, each question must stand on its own separate merit and also note, few people regularly post questions here or with high frequency esp those with high rep, and there is some possibility that frequent questions are actually informally frowned on via the voting mechanisms &amp; current collective voting tendencies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;the pattern is more in general that high rep users answer random newcomer questions. also, it is unlikely that you would get solid answers to all the separate (presumably nontrivial) questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;basically yes, that is part of the _raison d'etre_ of the group, to occasionally collaboratively generate scientific research to theoretical computer science in general &amp; complexity theory in particular (complexity theory entries even were once highlighted here in css formatting). however the conventions around this are new &amp; still being established as we speak.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1st, use the stackexchange search engine highly extensively and also the tag system, both can be very effective. find every relevant post to your paper or subject. figure out the best knowledge that is posted on the group. figure out the border between the known and unknown and what is posted vs not posted. this also requires close familiarity with nearby papers. it helps to bookmark or &quot;favorite&quot; all related posts on here &amp; elsewhere. use the related posts column on the right also. mix this with heavy cross use of google. in some cases you may find an expert on here posting on the subj. you can look at their own answers &amp; look at their papers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;next, try posting a single carefully crafted question totally centered on your subject and your paper and what you're thinking of establishing. its a delicate mix between the general (background) and the specific (the new result/concept you're aiming for). as if you have a single chance to ask the experts what you'd most want to know but what you also most think they'd be able to answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;responses will help you figure out what is known by the crowd but also how relevant it is to this group based on reaction in form of comments, enthusiasm, voting, etc. it has to be at a &quot;just right difficulty&quot; between too easy [not research] and too hard [you wont get replies/answers]. it takes some time to find that balance &amp; its an ongoing challenge. dont assume that if there is a good answer, someone will post it. dont assume that if people post answers, those are the best possible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;you will prob find if you are very focused that there are two gaps. one is the gap between what you want to establish in your paper and what is established in related literature. the other gap is what you can actually find out by using this group (both by searching it and posting questions). these two gaps are interrelated. you can judge whether you can build on all this with meaningful new results. but those key results will basically have to be generated by you, nobody else, unless you have found _offline_ collaborators in your own professional circles. you can use other results as a &quot;jumping off&quot; point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;so finally, leverage everything youve found and write a paper. if the answers on stackexchange are very notable and innovative, you can cite them in your paper using the stackexchange urls/&quot;cite&quot; feature. this is really not much different than citing blogs, which is occasionally done in real scientific papers. however note that this is somewhat problematic because content on here can disappear very easily due to voting, moderators, users [who can delete stuff] etc...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;probably the best and most successful model of all this invented so far is polymath[3] with a difficult problem and published arxiv paper to its credit but keep in mind this is a project started by a field medalist Gowers and promoted by his friends eg Tao and Kalai who are also very elite/accomplished theorists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/352/how-will-you-cite-a-discussion-on-this-site-in-your-paper&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[2] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/188/how-can-we-collaboratively-investigate-open-problems?rq=1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[3] [Massively collaborative mathematics/Polymath](http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1731)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[4] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/383/highlights-of-cstheory-stackexchange-com&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[5] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/697/what-interesting-open-problems-have-been-asked-on-this-stackexchange&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[6] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1316/attacking-open-questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[7] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1257/references-to-cstheory-in-the-literature&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[8] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/784/original-proofs-generated-on-the-parent-site&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[9] [Questions answered. in theory.](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/cstheory.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;(early tcs.se ad &amp;

It is a combined answer to the questions asked in both threads.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other question, which reads &quot;Are specific questions about Theorem X in paper Y fine?&quot; actually covers two types of questions from posters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Type 1: Questions like &quot;How does one reach eq 3.14 from eq 3.15 in paper X, page Y? I tried the following ... but it didn't work.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think most people would agree that these questions are appropriate for this site.

I don't see how it works for that case.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This question might be pointing out a genuine error in a paper. But then again it might just be something the poster did not understand. What I want to say is that it is often hard to tell whether there is a mistake/confusion/non-understanding on your part, or an error in the paper. These correspond to type 1 and 2 questions respectively. If the poster is not able to distinguish between the two types of questions, and if we make it a policy to only allow Type 1 questions and not Type 2, this will be hard for posters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Would a solution like the following work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We allow both type of questions. Questions of type 1 are handled as they usually are by the community. If we realize that it is a question of type 2 (i.e., there are answers which indicate that there is a genuine mistake in the paper), then a moderator emails the author of the paper and informs him of the thread, and offers to have the thread deleted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now the author may choose to have the thread deleted, or reply on the thread explaining how the poster has misunderstood and it is not an error, or reply thanking the poster for finding the error, or do nothing, etc. (I am assuming that moderators can delete threads.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/204/are-specific-questions-about-theorem-x-in-paper-y-fine" />

It would be nice if the moderators here would avoid migrating low-quality questions to CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I noticed recently a few low-quality questions that were migrated to the Computer Science Stack Exchange (CS.SE) site.  I would suggest that we avoid doing that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question, and on-topic for CS.SE, I definitely encourage you to migrate to CS.SE.  For instance, if it is not research-level but would be a reasonable question, migrating to CS.SE is a great idea.  Go for it!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question for CS.SE -- please don't migrate it to CS.SE.  If it's a bad question, just close it, don't migrate it.  Please don't make CS.SE a dumping ground for bad questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question -- well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, don't let that stop you from migrating.  If it's just the English, we can edit it over at CS.SE.  But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear -- I personally don't think it should be migrated over to CS.SE&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One recent example: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038.  In my opinion, that question shouldn't have been migrated to CS.SE.  It is not a good fit for the Computer Science Stack Exchange.  The question does not show evidence of effort.  It asks a question about a topic that is already covered by reference questions at CS.SE, with no evidence that the question-asker was aware of that.  These issues are not something that those of us at CS.SE can fix through simple edits to the question.  Of course, that's just one example.  I don't mean to pick on that one or focus on that one too much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kaveh explains that the CS.SE admins specifically requested that &quot;badly written&quot; questions are still OK to migrate to CS.SE.  I didn't realize that!  That explains a lot.  Perhaps that's something we should discuss.  I'm not sure whether &quot;badly written&quot; refers to the English/grammar, or to more fundamental issues (like whether it's a good question, whether it is well-researched, whether it is on-topic and focused and detailed and not a duplicate).  If the former, I agree, English/grammar problems should not be a barrier to migration.  If the latter, well, I guess I might have a slight difference of opinion with the CS.SE admins -- maybe that's something we need to discuss on CS.meta, instead of here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I certainly don't mean to imply that this is a huge, systemic problem that requires major changes to migration, and I don't mean to imply the moderators here are doing anything wrong (I think the moderators are doing a great job!).  Overall I think the process is generally working well.  I just wanted to suggest a minor refinement that I think might make things work better on CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1086/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1285/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1507/5038&#xD;&#xA;* [Do we want CSTheory.SE to migrate bad questions over here?](http://meta.cs.stackexchange.com/q/691/755)" />

Please do not post this question on this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **BAD**: Is the new claimed proof of (seminal problem in complexity) correct?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- *Answer*: If it's at all credible, be assured that people are reading it and trying to determine that.

If you can't check the correctness of the algorithm yourself, you should wait until it is [peer-reviewed][2] and [published][3]. The peer-review process does not take a very long time, if the paper hasn't been published after several years it is a strong sign that the paper has failed to pass the peer-review process and the author's claim is at least doubtful.

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.  It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the [faq](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(_Added in revision 5_: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq), not to the [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science).  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq) → [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science) → [What kind of questions are too basic?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What should we do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&#xD;&#xA;2. &lt;del&gt;On [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/), too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and [it certainly confuses some users](http://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/), but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- See a [related FAQ entry](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235) and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added in revision 4:_ Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.

I guess that Suresh already told the decision to Stack Overflow, and I do not know if it is possible or desirable to take it back.

This poll was done according to a procedure.

It only makes sense to those who know Stack Overflow, and the relation to TeX no longer makes sense because questions about TeX are no longer allowed there (in other words, they chose a name based on an element which was only tangentially related to the topic of the website).  However, as long as the content is good, these negative facts do not matter, at least to me.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It must have been surprising to some people that the name “CSTheory.org” was supported by most people.

Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise. **Make every... word... count.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some creative examples: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Gawker](http://gawker.com/): Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe. &#xD;&#xA;- [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/): The gadget guide. So much in love with shiny new toys, it’s unnatural. &#xD;&#xA;- [Autoblog](http://www.autoblog.com/): We obsessively cover the auto industry. &#xD;&#xA;- [DumbLittleMan](http://www.dumblittleman.com/): So what do we do here?

Mmmm…whipped cream. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Use it as a Tagline &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A shorter elevator pitch *can* be used as a tagline&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/): News for nerds. Stuff that matters. &#xD;&#xA;- [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/): Don’t live to geek, geek to live! &#xD;&#xA;- [The Simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/): Financial talk for the rest of us. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##The Motto (don't forget your logo) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A logo begs for it own little, short tagline&amp;thinsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;thinsp;like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Just do it. &#xD;&#xA;- Think Different. &#xD;&#xA;- The Uncola. &#xD;&#xA;- Intel inside. &#xD;&#xA;- Like a rock. &#xD;&#xA;- The king of beers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;hellip;and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site&amp;hellip; *eventually*.

Currently the majority of participants are graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but the number of senior researchers active within the site is growing quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though [cs.theory.stackexchange.com](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) is only two months old, it can already boast of 2,000 registered users, 700 answered questions, and -- perhaps most exciting -- [new research collaborations among computer scientists](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/when-should-you-say-what-you-know/2362#2362) who otherwise might never have realized that they were working on related problems.  The atmosphere of the site is a bit like a corridor discussion at a conference: researchers discuss and explain both folklore and the newest results, in a format that can be read at leisure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions and their answers are highly technical, but the answers from experts are often more than just answers; they contain insights that are not available in papers or textbooks.  For example, a student who requested a &quot;common sense&quot; explanation for how padding arguments related to complexity class separations received [an intuitive answer from Russell Impagliazzo](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/why-do-complexity-classes-translate-upwards-and-not-downwards/2453#2453); Scott Aaronson summarized the [state-of-the-art in non-relativizing techniques][6]; Jeff Erickson explained why [the real RAM model is preferred in computational geometry][7]; and a student who asked whether the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom number generator relativizes received [an answer from Noam Nisan](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2236/does-nisans-pseudo-random-generator-relativize/2239#2239).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions have also generated new proofs: Peter Shor gave a [reduction from Max-Cut with positive weights to a constant-factor approximation for the version of the problem with negative weights][8]; Jukka Suomela demonstrated that [DOMINATING SET remains NP-complete for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3][9]; Sariel Har-Peled showed that [Hamiltonicity is NP-complete for k-regular graphs for any fixed k][10]; and Per Vognsen outlined a [proof for the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma using projective geometry][11].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to specific technical questions, participants have asked for more general advice from the community, such as [how to referee papers][12], possible [Master's thesis topics in automata theory](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/979/automata-theory-formal-language-thesis-topic), pointers to [recent purely functional data structures][13], suggestions for an [inspirational talk about theoretical computer science][14], and [how to find a job](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2215/how-to-get-a-job).  The site is a place for the larger theory community to come together.  The overall scope of the site is **research-level theoretical computer science, broadly defined**.  _Note that homework questions are not allowed on the site_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Everyone with a research interest in theoretical computer science is welcome to create an account.  We encourage participation using real names -- and almost everybody does this -- but it's not required.  Participation costs nothing, and takes as little or as much time as you choose. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Site Origin and Structure###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the founding members of [cstheory.stackexchange.com](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) participated in discussion of a proposed solution to the P/NP problem that spanned multiple blogs, led to the creation of wiki pages, and brought together researchers in disparate fields from around the world.  This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a [&quot;Meta&quot; area][15], for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Who runs the site?###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now.

Read each of the candidate websites a little so that you can make an educated guess about where the best place for your question is.&#xD;&#xA;2. Post your question at only one website.&#xD;&#xA;3.

Thank you, Jin!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Edit: Below is my comments on revision 1._&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thank you for the interesting design.  I like this modern look.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few comments:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Logo&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be honest, I do not think the uppercase sigma is ideal as a logo.  The uppercase sigma is strongly related to discrete mathematics (because the symbol is used for summation), and it is true that theoretical computer science uses discrete mathematics a lot, but theoretical computer science is not the same as discrete mathematics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, without a better alternative, the uppercase sigma is an acceptable compromise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the [DFA idea](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33/what-should-our-logo-be/314#314) as is used in Suresh’s publicity materials, but it will not be recognizable in a 16×16-pixel favicon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Typewriter font&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the use of typewriter font in the website title written on a tape of a Turing machine.  On the other hand, as Suresh said, I am worried about the use of typewriter font in question titles, too, but for a different reason.  Some of the question titles are long, and typewriter font takes too much width.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not think that a mix of two fonts is bad by itself.  I am not sure if we want to use the same roman font in both question titles and question bodies just because they can contain MathJax math.  &lt;del&gt;In my (uneducated) opinion, question bodies are probably better in a roman font but question titles can be sans-serif.&lt;/del&gt;  _Edit: I removed the last sentence; see my reply to Jin in a comment._&#xD;&#xA;" />

As you know, SE has changed the Community Wiki policy and now only moderators can make a question a CW. Community Wiki has 2 main effects:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The question becomes owned by community, the original OP does not gain reputation,&#xD;&#xA;2. The required reputation to edit drops to 100,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and a side effect:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. The answers posted after a questions becomes a Community Wiki become Community Wiki automatically, i.e. the answers are owned by community, (but answers posted before the question becoming CW don't).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These three effects are not always correlated and there are cases that one wants to have one of these three but not the other two, e.g. the owner does not want to earn reputation but wants the users answering the question to earn reputation for their answers. So it seems to me that SE is mixing too many things in one concept and that is the main reason for many issues we had and have with CW policy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robin brought up the idea that we should make the non-CW answers to a CW question CW also. I have a problem with answers becoming CW when the question becomes CW because sometimes the answers deserve to earn reputation, but in the current situation it makes sense, if the answers need to be CW then the previous ones also need to be CW, on the other hand a user might not have answered a question if it was a CW question so I don't know what is the right thing to do here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see three clear reasons for making a question a CW (and it would be nice to add other reasons to this list):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. OP doesn't want to earn reputation (for some reason),&#xD;&#xA;2. OP wants to allow others to edit,&#xD;&#xA;3. the question is a ranking list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example I think a question like [this][1] and [this][2] should be CW but the answers should not be and the users answering them should earn reputation for their answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another issue is that the new policy is not clear on what we should do when we think a question or answer needs to be CW, I used to flag some posts for moderator attention but don't do it any more because I now think it is not very nice to suggest someone else question or answer should be CW to the moderators, so I have decided to go with a softer way of adding comments like &quot;I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have an proposal that I think might solve some issues and would like to hear what others think about it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In general the question or answer should be made CW only on the request of the owner (with some exceptions, see below), other users that think the post should be CW can leave a non-abusive comment like: &quot;nice answer, I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot; and up-vote only if/when it becomes CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exceptions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. the OP is a drive-by user and does not reply to the answers or comments after considerable time,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. some clear cases like: a ranking list. These should be explicitly included in the policy,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. other special situations where the moderators have strong reasons for making a question CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think about this proposal (agree, disagree, opinions, improvements and suggestions, ...) and CW in general? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**ps:**&#xD;&#xA;Another minor issue about CW is its (lack of) effect on badges, it seems strange that a user does not earn reputation but does earn badges for CW posts, e.g. I should not have earned a badges for [these answers](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/174/major-unsolved-problems-in-theoretical-computer-science/218#218).

I wanted to separate it out from the other discussion, though.  I'd like to start by contrasting two questions, one on StackOverflow, and one here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, consider [How do I move the turtle in LOGO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1003841/how-do-i-move-the-turtle-in-logo), especially the history of edits and closes.  A simple question with a simple answer, and, instead, it was repeatedly edited and closed by users who decided the question was fake, had nothing to do with programming, etc.  In this case, the asker was someone who wasn't leaving, so he clarified his position and eventually got an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now consider the question about [disproving the Church-Turing thesis](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/88/what-would-it-mean-to-disprove-church-turing-thesis).  In this case, I answered the question, it received a lot of upvotes, and was accepted by the asker.  However, in the months since that occurred, some of the finest minds in TCS have commented or answered that question, both explaining how wrong I was, and also sharing deep insights about the issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question I'd like people to consider is: Would you rather have a culture of arrogance, in which anyone with enough rep can decide, &quot;Get real, you couldn't possibly be Donald Knuth, I'm closing your question,&quot; or would you rather have a culture in which leading researchers feel comfortable adding to a question where a fairly high rep user already posted an accepted answer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question behind this question is, &quot;Why is there such a difference in the two sites?&quot;  I believe the answer lies in StackOverflow's fallacious belief that crowdsourcing is the best way to arrive at truth.  This may be the case for questions at the level of an Ask-the-Audience game show -- or even most in-the-trenches programming questions -- but when literally only a handful of people know the answer, and there are plenty of ways to deceive yourself that you solved the problem (when you didn't), the method breaks down.  Crowdsourcing does not produce truth; it only produces *an answer that nobody feels like debating any more*.  This lack of debate might arise because everyone is convinced, or because the few people who know the real answer don't see the point of participating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suresh has made the point well that a one-size-fits-all perspective about StackExchange sites does not work.  However, I believe this argument does not go far enough.  The quality of questions and answers on StackOverflow would *significantly increase* if that site were broken into smaller pieces.  If quality in answers is the priority, it should be harder than it currently is for C# experts to answer functional programming questions, as one example.  Rather than the academic caution that we have inherited -- not wanting to brashly say things about a field we know little about -- the StackOverflow model encourages people who get lots and lots of upvotes to answer questions in areas where there is little participation, because they'll get even more upvotes, and the people who know better aren't around, or don't want to start confrontation by calling them out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, on cstheory, if someone created a profile named &quot;Donald Knuth&quot; or &quot;Avi Wigderson&quot; or whoever, and asked a question, I bet everyone would be careful to treat that user like any other, and to treat the question professionally.  The content of the question is what is important, not &quot;making sure we're not being trolled&quot; or whatever.  I believe this attitude comes from our common belief in the importance of truth, as something beyond, &quot;Good enough,&quot; or, &quot;This is what works.&quot;  Moving forward, I think the most important thing to bear in mind is that we want to attract members who share that understanding of the primacy of mathematical truth.  That's what we share with others interested in theory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;StackExchange, of course, gets revenue as a function of number-of-hits, so I am sure they see the high traffic of StackOverflow as a great thing that should not be messed with by separating out pieces of it.  Ok, fine.  But if they are interested in more crossover among disciplines, they could, for example, institute a tag system that crosses sites.  So, for example, a chemist posting on biostar about the degree sequence of a molecular graph could see questions about degree sequences on cstheory -- and the graph theorist here could see a potential application for the theoretical work!  Personally, I would *love* such a feature.  I'd like to ask Joel Spolsky and Robert Cartaino to work on *that*, instead of asking us to adapt to the StackOverflow site model, which would not serve us well." />

Currently area tags are named in the following way:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The area tags which originate from [CoRR subject areas](http://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses) are named as `xx.description` where `xx` is the coresponding CoRR subject area codes and `description` is the descriptive name of the area.  Examples are [tag:cr.crypto-security], [tag:cg.comp-geom], [tag:ds.algorithms] and [tag:ds.data-structures].  Note that some area tags deviate from the categorization in CoRR.&#xD;&#xA;- The other area tags are labeled like usual tags.  Examples are [tag:computability] and [tag:quantum-computing].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two problems with the current area tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Names depend on whether they originate from CoRR subject areas or not, which is not an important distinction.  Therefore tags look simply inconsistent.&#xD;&#xA;- There is no advantage of having the corresponding CoRR subject area codes in the tags.  As I understand it, the only purpose of these codes is to indicate that they are area tags.  However, this is incomplete because not every area tag has a two-letter code.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that a more consistent naming is better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the Stack Exchange server had a functionality of showing area tags in a different color, we would not have to distinguish them by names.  Because it does not have such a functionality, it is better to distinguish area tags by names.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, I propose the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Proposal**.  Remove the `xx.` part from the area tags of the form `xx.description` and instead add a fixed prefix to all the area tags.  As the fixed prefix, I suggest to use either `a.` (for “area”) or just `.`.  [_Edit_: I removed the earlier suggestions `a:` and `:` because it turned out that a colon cannot be used in tags.]&#xD;&#xA;" />

Too much personal tone can be distracting, and reducing the personal tone can improve the readability of a question (or perhaps also an answer).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this particular example, the question before the edit sounds a little like a diary rather than a question written as a question from the beginning.  It is fine in a blog, but it is probably suboptimal on a Q&amp;A website.  I guess that this is why Kaveh felt the need for an edit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in this particular example, I do not think that it was done well.  I do not like the opening after the edit:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There is always a way for application in topics related to theoretical computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Despite the intent of the edit which Kaveh explained, this does not sound like a professional to me.  Instead, it sounds like some newbie who tries to pretend to be a professional.  Frankly speaking, the question sounded at least honest before the edit, but it sounds pretentious after the edit.  I am sorry, but I do not like how the question is stated after the edit at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, it should be pointed out that [we encourage to include a personal motivation in a question](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300/how-to-ask-a-good-question/306#306): we want a question which the asker cares out of his/her own interest rather than a question which the asker thinks that someone cares.  In this sense, good questions necessarily contain some personal part.  I do not think that it is right to remove everything personal from a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thinking this way, it seems very difficult to edit a question to reduce the personal tone while maintaining some degree of personality.  If you do it, you should do it right.  I guess that it is a perfectly reasonable choice to give up such a difficult task and just either leave the question open or close it.&#xD;&#xA;" />

What I'm proposing is that we suggest that these questions be posted on our chat system. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This idea is actually due to [Artem Kaznatcheev in an answer][1] [to this question][2]. I think it's an interesting suggestion for three reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. It allows us to keep such questions 'in-house' without watering down the quality of questions on the main site. This would encourage people who might not otherwise be able to be on the site to participate, and over time they might be able to &quot;graduate&quot; to questions on the main site. &#xD;&#xA;2. It allows us to use the chat feature, which has been left unused thus far. Since many of the questions of this nature that people post have quick answers, the chat system enables that quick back-and-forth&#xD;&#xA;3. Participation is 'opt-in': since the chat system isn't front and center, there's no danger that people uninterested in answering such questions might be forced to wade through pages and pages to get to the 'research-level' questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One fear that we've had in the past with allowing lower-level questions is that we'd get swamped with such questions and that things like reputation counts and question scores would get biased towards answering such questions. Keeping them in the chat system ensures that questions get answered, but this doesn't happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thoughts ? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1460/80&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1459/simple-questions-during-reading-papers" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - cool site-related open source apps&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - script packs or power tools&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle.

We have discussed previously (see [this](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1264/) and [this](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1395/)) that we are not going to require or even demand people to explain their votes. When I see a down-vote that I don't understand I politely comment that I don't understand it, but I think demanding an explanation or stating that there is no reason for the down-vote goes too far. It is not an abuse if people are using their votes in a way different from us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have argued a number of times that I am against counter-voting, that is voting to null the effect of another user's vote. Everyone has their own opinion. The total reflects the opinion of the community, it is not the job of any particular user to decide what the total should be. Counter-voting encourages other users to do the same and use their votes to null votes in place of express their opinion about the question. Each vote is a manifestation of some user's opinion and if we respect their opinions then we should respect their votes even when we disagree with them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is more productive if we comment and explain why we think it is a suitable and interesting question in place of just asking others why they have down-voted the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this particular case, I see several possible reasons for a down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Formating: It is using an image in place of writing the expression which I think has been one of the reasons people down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Content: The questions seems to simply ask how to calculate some expression for some particular values. It seems to ask how to apply a method explained in a paper in a particular case in practice. It is too localized and it doesn't seem to be a _research-level_ question in _theoretical_ computer science. It is also unclear what is the trouble the OP is facing in calculating the expression.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask me I think we are being too open right now (I guess it is partly because people get bored that there are not as many questions as they would like) to questions which should not be here and are more suitable for CS.SE.

And [this](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18903/how-would-the-use-of-ternary-computers-change-complexity-of-algorithms) is clearly not-research level in my opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=close&amp;daterange=last30days" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - cool site-related open source apps&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - script packs or power tools&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

This website allows me to keep my finger on the pulse of other subfields and see what sort of questions are interesting others and how they think about certain problems. As such, I think cstheory is primarily a great way to bring the community together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the longer term, my hope is to use the [algorithmic lens](http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2013/09/15/algorithmic-lens/) as a viewpoint on other sciences and I hope others do so as well. If non-computer scientists start using tools from cstheory then this website (and its placement among other science and math websites in the SE network) could provide a great way for us to engage with them, and share our knowledge while figuring out what problems they want to use our tools to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would address the specific flags through comments, discuss with the other moderators, and if the behavior persists contact the user over chat. If direct communication with the user does not resolve the issue then I would consider a suspension for some amount of time and contact over email (if such means are available).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would contact the mod in private. If after a discussion we are still unsure of the decision then I would raise the question in meta for input from the community. However, I doubt this would come up since in my experience so far I have not seen closed questions for which I disagreed with closing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my answer to the first question, I described my views for this site in cstheory and the larger scientific community. I think we are already moving toward this organically, but it might help to show more clearly why cstheory is a worthwhile part of a researcher's workflow by generating more answers to lists like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Original proofs generated on the parent site](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/784/1037)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*[References to cstheory in the literature](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1257/1037)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is important to judge questions by their own merit. The only time I would let my knowledge of the users previous activity affect my decision is if I am unsure about the questions. However, in these cases of being unsure, I will never act before the community voices their opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a special case of questions that accidentally capture a deeper issue, and are simple when read at a surface level but significant at a deeper level. In this case, I think it is important to engage with the user through comments to see if this deeper exploration will serve the user, or if they were just looking for the easy answer. This is often a judgement of the users &quot;mathematical maturity&quot;. If they were not looking for a deeper discussion, and the question is fine otherwise, I would consider migration to CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators should interfere as little as possible with community self-governance, and act decisively only in clear cut cases where the community guidelines are already set. Moderators should also act as unbiased intermediaries in case of heated discussions and encourage good behavior by example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It will not change how I ask or answer questions. However, I will actively take note to make sure my comments are always unbiased, constructive, and within community norms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only differences I know is the binding vote and diamond (I guess there are also some drastic actions like suspension, but I will hopefully never have to use those). As someone that spends an unreasonable amount of time on the internet, the binding vote will allow me to act decisively and quickly in clear cut cases. Since &quot;close&quot; now means &quot;on hold&quot;, this will hopefully improve questions. The diamond will allow me to set a good example in my actions on the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would encourage use of our third space (i.e. the chat room) to avoid some of the chatty discussions. However, otherwise I would leave the decision on this policy to more experienced moderators or the community (maybe we should raise a meta discussion on this?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I mentioned in my first answer, I see helping researchers with their research as only part of the goals of this site. I think it is also a way to communicate with other disciplines, and a way to build community. Further, it is a way for future researchers to keep an idea of what the community is interested in, and learn from reading others questions and answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes? E.g. users who are not researchers in theoretical computer science or any related field and insist on posting questions/answers/comments that are off-topic by the site's policies, e.g. cranks that want to use the site to verify or draw attention to their attempts on famous open problems?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We already have a [policy on crank-friendly preprints and topics](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/274/1037), I will enforce this policy. I don't think we have gotten too many problems with cranky users, especially compared to other SE sites. We have a great community that already deals with this well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How can we make sure the site will not be overridden by users who are not researchers so cstheory does not suffer the faith of other online open resources for researchers like Usenet groups? (Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can make sure of this by continuing to ask great research-level questions and providing amazing answers. However, I do agree that the reputation mechanism on the site is broken and it is easy for a persistent user to accumulate reputation. These sort of users are unavoidable, and in most cases they don't cause much trouble. However, if a specific user continually upsets the community then I will proceed as in the &quot;large number of arguments/flags&quot; question: discuss with the user and community and suspend if necessary." />

I imagine this would be something like: any of their questions must be approved by, say, 3 or 4 users with sufficient rep before the question appears on the site. This would be a pre-filtering approach to questions rather than the current post-filtering approach.

In other words, is cross-posting on CS.SE and TCS.SE OK (rather than migrating) if there is a delay of a week between them?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm asking to see if I can clarify the policy, because I am confused.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be clear: I am not asking about simultaneous cross-posting.  I'm asking about cross-posting after a delay of a week, when the question didn't get an answer on the original site. I'm not talking about migrating a question or deleting the original one and posting it on a new site; I'm talking about cross-posting, where the question is open on both CS.SE and TCS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is what I have been able to find:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The standard StackExchange policy is: it is not OK to cross-post the same question on multiple sites.  If you post it on one site and after a week or two don't get an answer, you can flag it to ask the moderators to migrate it, but you should not cross-post (not even after a week or two).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Source: http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/64068/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Currently, the TCS policy says that it is OK to cross-post on TCS.SE and MathOverflow, if you post on one and don't get an answer even after waiting a week or so (and if you must cross-link the two).  However this doesn't say anything about other SE sites other than MathOverflow, so it's not clear if this applies more broadly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Source: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/a/231/5038&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- There was a proposal to change that policy to allow simultaneous cross-posting on TCS.SE and MO, but that proposal was marked status-declined (it was rejected).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Source: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/673/5038&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Peter Shor points out that one of the close reasons says&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; Our [site policy](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/a/231/5038) prohibits ***simultaneous* crossposting**: it duplicates effort and fractures discussion. Crossposting is permitted after a week has passed without a satisfying answer elsewhere. When crossposting please summarize the relevant discussions from other sites in your question and link between the copies in both directions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This sure sounds like cross-posting after a delay is allowed.  On the other hand, when you click on the link to the &quot;site policy&quot;, the policy described at the link target actually only mentions MathOverflow, not other SE sites.  (I hadn't noticed this previously, because I don't have enough reputation to vote to close.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- CS.SE does not seem to have any special policy about this, and I can't find any discussion of this on Meta.CS.SE.  Therefore, I would assume that CS.SE abides by the standard StackExchange policy, by default.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Also, given the standard StackExchange policy and the impact on both sites, I would guess that probably cross-posting on two SE sites should only be allowed if both sites opt into a policy of allowing cross-posting.  CS.SE does not seem to have opted to allow cross-posting on CS.SE+TCS.SE, and since I can't find any clear evidence that TCS.SE has, either.  (It appears that before adopting the current policy regarding cross-posting on TCS.SE+MO, both TCS.SE and MO were consulted; however, I can't find any evidence of any consultation with CS.SE about cross-posting on CS.SE+TCS.SE.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My conclusion: It's not clear to me what is allowed.  The information on the policy does not seem entirely self-consistent, to my eyes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what *is* the current policy?  Is cross-posting on CS.SE and TCS.SE allowed, if you wait a week?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And if this has not been previously addressed, what *should* the policy be?" />

This adds a barrier for adding new answers. I think it is a reasonable barrier, in a sense we are saying that these questions are special and potentially problematic so they are required to pass higher standards. To post an answer you have to first show that you are contributing positively in a sense before being able to post your answer to a big-list question. The same applies informally to big-list questions, i.e. they are expected to pass a higher standard of quality otherwise they get several down-votes and/or closed as too broad. (So far those standards are left subjectively to users, I don't think we have discussed or spelled out a guideline on what we expect from big-list questions/answers.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I should also add that some of these big-list questions are extremely useful.

It would be nice if the moderators here would avoid migrating low-quality questions to CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I noticed recently a few low-quality questions that were migrated to the Computer Science Stack Exchange (CS.SE) site.  I would suggest that we avoid doing that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question, and on-topic for CS.SE, I definitely encourage you to migrate to CS.SE.  For instance, if it is not research-level but would be a reasonable question, migrating to CS.SE is a great idea.  Go for it!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question for CS.SE -- please don't migrate it to CS.SE.  If it's a bad question, just close it, don't migrate it.  Please don't make CS.SE a dumping ground for bad questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question -- well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, don't let that stop you from migrating.  If it's just the English, we can edit it over at CS.SE.  But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear -- I personally don't think it should be migrated over to CS.SE&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One recent example: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038.  In my opinion, that question shouldn't have been migrated to CS.SE.  It is not a good fit for the Computer Science Stack Exchange.  The question does not show evidence of effort.  It asks a question about a topic that is already covered by reference questions at CS.SE, with no evidence that the question-asker was aware of that.  These issues are not something that those of us at CS.SE can fix through simple edits to the question.  Of course, that's just one example.  I don't mean to pick on that one or focus on that one too much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kaveh explains that the CS.SE admins specifically requested that &quot;badly written&quot; questions are still OK to migrate to CS.SE.  I didn't realize that!  That explains a lot.  Perhaps that's something we should discuss.  I'm not sure whether &quot;badly written&quot; refers to the English/grammar, or to more fundamental issues (like whether it's a good question, whether it is well-researched, whether it is on-topic and focused and detailed and not a duplicate).  If the former, I agree, English/grammar problems should not be a barrier to migration.  If the latter, well, I guess I might have a slight difference of opinion with the CS.SE admins -- maybe that's something we need to discuss on CS.meta, instead of here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I certainly don't mean to imply that this is a huge, systemic problem that requires major changes to migration, and I don't mean to imply the moderators here are doing anything wrong (I think the moderators are doing a great job!).  Overall I think the process is generally working well.  I just wanted to suggest a minor refinement that I think might make things work better on CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1086/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1285/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1507/5038&#xD;&#xA;* [Do we want CSTheory.SE to migrate bad questions over here?](https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/691/755)" />

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.  It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the [faq](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(_Added in revision 5_: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq), not to the [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science).  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq) → [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science) → [What kind of questions are too basic?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What should we do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&#xD;&#xA;2. &lt;del&gt;On [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/), too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and [it certainly confuses some users](https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/), but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- See a [related FAQ entry](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235) and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added in revision 4:_ Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.  Here is the description of the close reason “too localized”:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of the suggestion 2 above is that it is at least possible to argue that too elementary questions fall into the third group (and possibly also the second group) of this description.&#xD;&#xA;" />

As you know, SE has changed the Community Wiki policy and now only moderators can make a question a CW. Community Wiki has 2 main effects:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The question becomes owned by community, the original OP does not gain reputation,&#xD;&#xA;2. The required reputation to edit drops to 100,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and a side effect:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. The answers posted after a questions becomes a Community Wiki become Community Wiki automatically, i.e. the answers are owned by community, (but answers posted before the question becoming CW don't).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These three effects are not always correlated and there are cases that one wants to have one of these three but not the other two, e.g. the owner does not want to earn reputation but wants the users answering the question to earn reputation for their answers. So it seems to me that SE is mixing too many things in one concept and that is the main reason for many issues we had and have with CW policy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robin brought up the idea that we should make the non-CW answers to a CW question CW also. I have a problem with answers becoming CW when the question becomes CW because sometimes the answers deserve to earn reputation, but in the current situation it makes sense, if the answers need to be CW then the previous ones also need to be CW, on the other hand a user might not have answered a question if it was a CW question so I don't know what is the right thing to do here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see three clear reasons for making a question a CW (and it would be nice to add other reasons to this list):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. OP doesn't want to earn reputation (for some reason),&#xD;&#xA;2. OP wants to allow others to edit,&#xD;&#xA;3. the question is a ranking list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example I think a question like [this][1] and [this][2] should be CW but the answers should not be and the users answering them should earn reputation for their answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another issue is that the new policy is not clear on what we should do when we think a question or answer needs to be CW, I used to flag some posts for moderator attention but don't do it any more because I now think it is not very nice to suggest someone else question or answer should be CW to the moderators, so I have decided to go with a softer way of adding comments like &quot;I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have an proposal that I think might solve some issues and would like to hear what others think about it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In general the question or answer should be made CW only on the request of the owner (with some exceptions, see below), other users that think the post should be CW can leave a non-abusive comment like: &quot;nice answer, I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot; and up-vote only if/when it becomes CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exceptions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. the OP is a drive-by user and does not reply to the answers or comments after considerable time,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. some clear cases like: a ranking list. These should be explicitly included in the policy,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. other special situations where the moderators have strong reasons for making a question CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think about this proposal (agree, disagree, opinions, improvements and suggestions, ...) and CW in general? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**ps:**&#xD;&#xA;Another minor issue about CW is its (lack of) effect on badges, it seems strange that a user does not earn reputation but does earn badges for CW posts, e.g. I should not have earned a badges for [these answers](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/174/major-unsolved-problems-in-theoretical-computer-science/218#218).

What do you think?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another issue is the bounty system. It seems to me that recently, none of the questions with bounties have been answered in the bounty time period. The same problem [occurs in MO][10], which may due to both sites are theoretical oriented, and since it is related to the system of SE, we do not have too much we can do. Is there any solution to the bounty problem, despite the fact that it serves as a [mechanism to attract more attention][11]?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Final thoughts, it seems that most of the traffics comes from a particular region of the world (maybe US), since there is a low traffic gap (for about 8 hours) in the posts. Not a problem but an observation, but I do expect more experts and grad students all over the world to join our community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep going, see how far we can reach :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3756/why-is-it-tn-4-work-for-each-block-of-the-matrix-in-this-divide-and-conquer-tra&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/522/beta-period-progress&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/522/beta-period-progress/544#544&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6/vote-early-and-often&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/601/flood-of-homework-questions&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/522/beta-period-progress/524#524&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://stackexchange.com/sites&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8766/theoretical-computer-science&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://stackexchange.com/leagues/44/month/cstheory/2010-12-01?sort=reputationchange&amp;page=3&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/710/the-bounty-time-is-just-too-short/#Item_0&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/246/if-nobody-responds-to-a-bounty-why-do-you-still-lose-the-rep/#Item_0" />

We are drawing lines about what is appropriate too strictly. We are being too conservative, the default position should be trusting decisions made by other users. If there is a disagreement, if the OP comes back and says I want this removed for some reasons, then we can discuss it, but as long as there is not a conflict, we should be very liberal about what users can do. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What are we going to do if a user copies a deleted answer and posts it? Are we going to down vote it? Are we going to delete it? What if a number of users undelete a post. The system permits other users to undelete posts, even if it is deleted by the OP. Are we going to punish the users for undeleting it? Are we going to delete it again?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also don't see any reason legally or ethically for not copying an answer. What is the ethical principle that is being violated? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IMHO, copying answers is completely compatible with the philosophy of the site. Let me quote a part of FAQ:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Other people can edit my stuff?!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Like Wikipedia, this site is collaboratively edited, and all edits are tracked. **If you are not comfortable with the idea of your questions and answers being edited by other trusted users, this may not be the site for you.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is clear about the philosophy of SE. If you are not happy about copying answers, I respect your view. But if you are saying that it is inappropriate or unethical and/or if you are trying to draw lines too strictly about how other users or moderators should act, and about what is appropriate and what is not, sorry, but I don't agree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;###Edit 10/26/2010&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I agree with Tsuyoshi that there is not a need to agree on everything, i.e. I agree with Tsuyoshi to disagree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My main point here is on how conservative we should be on what trusted users/moderators can do.** My view, as I wrote above, is that we should trust decisions made by others and be very liberal, we don't need to discuss every decision made by others, unless there is a conflict/disagreement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me also make it clear that there is a difference between being nice to others and what is ethical. An action can be considered &quot;not being nice to others&quot;, but still don't violate any ethical principles. Being nice is boarder than being ethical (in this context).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, let me return to the particular case of this question.&#xD;&#xA;My sentence about the ethical principle being violated is in the context of our discussion, i.e. the appropriate use of *this site*. The argument, if I understood it correctly, is that we should respect the decision made by OP about deleting their post, and I guess this is based on the view that *OP own what they have posted*. I am not sure I agree with this. Again if I understood the philosophy of the site correctly, it is very similar to Wikipedia, and it is a collaborative effort. If you have posted something, others can modify, edit, or even copy-and-post it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some discussion on why it is not clear to me if a post is owned by OP, specially a CW post:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I. When someone posts an answer/questions, it means that other users are probably going to avoid posting similar content,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;II. People vote for the answer,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;III. Other answers may refer to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Removing a post can also be considered as not respecting the questioner, other user answering the question, and the votes given to the answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, if it is CW, i.e. *community wiki*, it is more involved. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IV. CW answers are owned by community, they are edited by other users, and removing a post can cause even more problems in this case. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assume that we have a CW question about what is the most famous problem in TCS, and someone posts &quot;$P$ vs $NP$&quot;, and of course receive lots of votes, after a few months the OP goes back and removes the answer. Assume that no one notices this. Think how it would look like if someone from outside or a new user reads the question and does not see an &quot;$P$ vs $NP$&quot; answer?! And even if another users posts it again, how many times do other uses have to vote for the same answer? Should we expect them to vote once every time someone removes it and someone else reposts an answer which is essentially the same?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest you read this post: [What can cause a post to be deleted, and what does that actually mean?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5221/what-can-cause-a-post-to-be-deleted-and-what-does-that-actually-mean/5222#5222)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In particular, this part:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When can't I delete my own post?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You can't delete your answer if it has been accepted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You can't delete your question if it has more than two answers, if an answer has a score &gt;= 2, or it has been closed less than 48 hours ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are restrictions on when an answer can be removed by OP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summery, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I. it is not clear to me that OP owns what they post, specially CW posts,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;II. deleting a good highly-voted post by OP (without stating any reasons) can also be considered disrespect towards other users, and may cause problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just to make it clear, I agree that we should be nice to others, and if the OP complains about undeleting their post (and states some reasons for it) I would support the OP, but IMO, the default position should be that &quot;posts can be undeleted by others, even if OP have removed it&quot;, specially if they are good and highly-voted." />

As you know, SE has changed the Community Wiki policy and now only moderators can make a question a CW. Community Wiki has 2 main effects:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The question becomes owned by community, the original OP does not gain reputation,&#xD;&#xA;2. The required reputation to edit drops to 100,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and a side effect:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. The answers posted after a questions becomes a Community Wiki become Community Wiki automatically, i.e. the answers are owned by community, (but answers posted before the question becoming CW don't).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These three effects are not always correlated and there are cases that one wants to have one of these three but not the other two, e.g. the owner does not want to earn reputation but wants the users answering the question to earn reputation for their answers. So it seems to me that SE is mixing too many things in one concept and that is the main reason for many issues we had and have with CW policy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robin brought up the idea that we should make the non-CW answers to a CW question CW also. I have a problem with answers becoming CW when the question becomes CW because sometimes the answers deserve to earn reputation, but in the current situation it makes sense, if the answers need to be CW then the previous ones also need to be CW, on the other hand a user might not have answered a question if it was a CW question so I don't know what is the right thing to do here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see three clear reasons for making a question a CW (and it would be nice to add other reasons to this list):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. OP doesn't want to earn reputation (for some reason),&#xD;&#xA;2. OP wants to allow others to edit,&#xD;&#xA;3. the question is a ranking list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example I think a question like [this][1] and [this][2] should be CW but the answers should not be and the users answering them should earn reputation for their answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another issue is that the new policy is not clear on what we should do when we think a question or answer needs to be CW, I used to flag some posts for moderator attention but don't do it any more because I now think it is not very nice to suggest someone else question or answer should be CW to the moderators, so I have decided to go with a softer way of adding comments like &quot;I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have an proposal that I think might solve some issues and would like to hear what others think about it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In general the question or answer should be made CW only on the request of the owner (with some exceptions, see below), other users that think the post should be CW can leave a non-abusive comment like: &quot;nice answer, I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot; and up-vote only if/when it becomes CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exceptions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. the OP is a drive-by user and does not reply to the answers or comments after considerable time,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. some clear cases like: a ranking list. These should be explicitly included in the policy,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. other special situations where the moderators have strong reasons for making a question CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think about this proposal (agree, disagree, opinions, improvements and suggestions, ...) and CW in general? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**ps:**&#xD;&#xA;Another minor issue about CW is its (lack of) effect on badges, it seems strange that a user does not earn reputation but does earn badges for CW posts, e.g. I should not have earned a badges for [these answers](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/174/major-unsolved-problems-in-theoretical-computer-science/218#218).

The official explanation for this restriction, which I cannot find where I saw for now, is “Allowing unlimited undoing would open up the possibility of gaming the system.”  Namely, if you want your answer to be voted up, you could vote down the other answers so that your answer will be shown on the top of the page (because the other answers have now negative score) and lazy users will read only your answer and upvote it.  The downside of this strategy is that you lose 1 rep point every time you cast a downvote, but if you can undo the votes, you can cancel your downvotes after a week or so when no one cares what happens in a question which does not appear on the top page.  Moreover, canceling the downvotes hides the evidence that you have cast many downvotes (the number of upvotes and downvotes you have cast is available on your profile page).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many (seemingly silly) restrictions on Stack Exchange websites like this originate from the same logic of preventing gaming the system.  I guess that these restrictions came from the real experience by the admins at Stack Overflow Internet Services, Inc., on Stack Overflow and other sites which have longer history than ours.  I appreciate the fact that the admins put their experiences to form the whole Stack Exchange network.  However, I am worried by their general tendency of overreacting to the fear that someone may game the system.  I believe that different communities have different priorities and that earning the rep points is not considered to be as important in cstheory.stackexchange.com as in more popular sites such as Stack Overflow.  I understand that it is sometimes difficult to prevent abusing without ruining the usability for legitimate users, but I hope that they will take the difference like this into account to design the system.&#xD;&#xA;" />

This means that in most cases, closed questions with negative score which are more than 30 days old and closed questions with score 0 which are more than 365 days old will be deleted and not included in the table.  Therefore, the actual number and the actual rate of closed questions for more than one month old will be higher than shown in the table.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Warning**.  I am not familiar with SQL, the language in which this query is written.  Therefore, the query may well contain a bug.

Unfortunately this is not an evidence for a time machine.  This question was migrated from another site, and it was posted in 2008 in the original site.  Ideally the query should use the month when the question started to appear on cstheory.stackexchange.com, but I currently ignore this issue because this should affect only the migrated questions and there are not many of them." />

I think it's a lousy feature; it disincentives improvements to questions and answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately it has been suggested previously on Meta.Stackoverflow many times over the past 4 years, and it looks very unlikely that it will be changed:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8654/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/192434/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/179746/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/183918/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/179901/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/333/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/155621/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/181436/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/79250/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/157928/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apparently, the rationale given for the existing auto-CW-conversion behavior is that the site designers were worried that people would continually edit their question to bump it to the front page of the site.  I personally don't think the current behavior is the best solution to that problem, but whatever: it's clear that the site developers have a different view, that they have thought about this, they do have reasons for the current behavior, and ultimately, this is unlikely to change (at least, not in the foreseeable future).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For now, no changes seem likely to come our way.&#xD;&#xA;Instead, the standard workaround seems to be: if you notice that a question/answer was auto-converted to CW inappropriately, flag it for a moderator (flag as &quot;needs moderator attention&quot;), and ask the moderator to please reverse the community wiki status.  Moderators have that ability.  Apparently, many moderators have stated that they do routinely grant these requests (absent concrete reasons not to), and it is considered legitimate to ask the moderators to do so.  See, e.g.,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/179756/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/192784/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/192438/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/83373/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/179825/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, you'll still lose any rep that was accumulated between when the answer was auto-converted to CW and when the moderator reverts the CW status.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My proposal:** Our moderators should routinely and gladly grant such flag requests, as long as there has not been any signs of abuse.  We should be grateful to anyone who takes the time to improve their questions or answers, as long as they're not abusing the feature to try to bump their question/answer to the front page.  I don't think our moderators should refuse to grant such flags (e.g., on the basis that they're going to wait for this behavior to be changed -- as it's pretty clear this behavior is not going to be changed any time soon).  That just penalizes people who put extra time and energy into improving their questions/answers." />

If you post it on one site and after a week or two don't get an answer, you can flag it to ask the moderators to migrate it, but you should not cross-post (not even after a week or two).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Source: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/64068/160917&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Currently, the TCS policy says that it is OK to cross-post on TCS.SE and MathOverflow, if you post on one and don't get an answer even after waiting a week or so (and if you must cross-link the two).  However this doesn't say anything about other SE sites other than MathOverflow, so it's not clear if this applies more broadly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Source: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/a/231/5038&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- There was a proposal to change that policy to allow simultaneous cross-posting on TCS.SE and MO, but that proposal was marked status-declined (it was rejected).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Source: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/673/5038&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Peter Shor points out that one of the close reasons says&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; Our [site policy](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/a/231/5038) prohibits ***simultaneous* crossposting**: it duplicates effort and fractures discussion. Crossposting is permitted after a week has passed without a satisfying answer elsewhere. When crossposting please summarize the relevant discussions from other sites in your question and link between the copies in both directions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  This sure sounds like cross-posting after a delay is allowed.  On the other hand, when you click on the link to the &quot;site policy&quot;, the policy described at the link target actually only mentions MathOverflow, not other SE sites.  (I hadn't noticed this previously, because I don't have enough reputation to vote to close.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- CS.SE does not seem to have any special policy about this, and I can't find any discussion of this on Meta.CS.SE.  Therefore, I would assume that CS.SE abides by the standard StackExchange policy, by default.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Also, given the standard StackExchange policy and the impact on both sites, I would guess that probably cross-posting on two SE sites should only be allowed if both sites opt into a policy of allowing cross-posting.  CS.SE does not seem to have opted to allow cross-posting on CS.SE+TCS.SE, and since I can't find any clear evidence that TCS.SE has, either.  (It appears that before adopting the current policy regarding cross-posting on TCS.SE+MO, both TCS.SE and MO were consulted; however, I can't find any evidence of any consultation with CS.SE about cross-posting on CS.SE+TCS.SE.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My conclusion: It's not clear to me what is allowed.  The information on the policy does not seem entirely self-consistent, to my eyes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, what *is* the current policy?

For instance, there might be a good answer on one but not the other.  Even if they are cross-linked, this makes it harder than necessary for others to discover the answer to the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. It makes it harder for others who have the same question to find the question and benefit from the answers we've built up.

If you migrate, the question disappears from the old site.  The old URL doesn't stop working -- it redirects to the location on the new site, so Google searches that turn up the old URL will still get you to the right place -- but search on the new site will no longer turn up the old question.  This makes it impossible for people who have the same question to find the old question by searching on the old site.  To find it, they'd have to either search on Google or search on the new site.  So, if the question was squarely within scope on the old site, this makes it harder to find the information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This means there are some pros and cons either way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Weighing the pros and cons, I'd suggest we stick with the default StackExchange policy and prohibit cross-posting on CS.SE and TCS.SE (cross-posting shouldn't be allowed, not even if you wait a week or two for an answer and get nothing)." />

Sanity check: Yes, there are plenty of reasons a question might be asked here that really belongs on the more general CS site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Gather statistics: In the past 90 days, there have been [6 migrations to and from CS Theory](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/posts/migrated/stats):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        cs.stackexchange.com          =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 4 (25% rejected)&#xD;&#xA;        datascience.stackexchange.com =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;        cstheory.stackexchange.com    =&gt; cs.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   This is underwhelming. It seems that in practice, people are pretty good about posting to CS when they have a non-research-level question. Just one question has been migrated away. It does not seem as if the moderators are being overwhelmed with migration flags. It's also instructive that there are few migrations the other direction. (A 25% rejection rate would be a red flag if it were not just one question.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I don't see a lot of evidence that this path is needed. Looking at the [close statistics](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/question-close-stats?daterange=last90days) it seems that the custom close reason that directs people to post to CS on their own is the prefered solution. 115 questions have been closed that way over the same time period.

As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What are Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - cool site-related open source apps&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be **300 x 250 pixels**, or double that if high DPI.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of **150 KB**&#xD;&#xA; - **If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2925" />

While I try to judge this proposal on its own merit, it is likely that the time and energy I have invested in CS.SE influences me.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm afraid that broadening the scope in this way would destroy the existing community. A Stack Exchange site is defined by two things: the kind of questions it accepts, and the audience it attracts. Even though each question is in principle judged on its intrinsic merits, the long-term effect is to create a community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On this site, the community is centered around researchers in theoretical computer science. Participants tend to be researchers in TCS, researchers in other fields, or graduate students aspiring to become researchers. The participants who are welcomed are generally those who came with the expectation of participating in a community dominated by TCS researchers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not see a problem with allowing more applied questions. As long as academics and people who want to fit in with academics dominate the site, that isn't a problem. It may be difficult to bootstrap an applied CS community (it would have been a lot easier to do when the site was young), but if it works, it won't change the tone of the site, and if it fails, the site won't have changed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, opening the door to more basic questions means opening the door to a broader audience. This should be a carefully controlled process. In particular, I advise you not to try to draw on Stack Overflow as an audience base. A majority of Stack Overflow does not know or care what it means to be a scientist. The kind of people you would attract are those who now post on [Programmers](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/). If you attract those people, be prepared to moderate their content. And to moderate them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reacting to specific points in your proposal:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We now have a natural forum (cs.stackexchange.com) for the more &quot;basic&quot; algorithms questions, and the cstheory &quot;brand&quot; is well established as a 'research-only' venue. So we have an easy process to shunt questions that are obviously undergrad level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that CS.SE is not exclusively for basic questions. It is for questions at all level, ranging all the way from CS 101 homework to applied research (and even research in theory, but we suggest CSTheory.SE to the rare asker who comes with a theory question that seems to go unanswered because it is too hard).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; excluding questions from people who might be 'research-level' in a sub area but aren't experts in some other domain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From what I see (I admit to not following CSTheory.SE very closely), this already happens: as long as there's a feeling that peers are talking with peers, questions tend to be appreciated, left open and answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; creating the impression of an unfriendly site (which is a bigger problem in terms of maintaining the audience)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the community is doing an adequate job of retaining the audience it likes in and keeping the undesirables in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, while the current guidelines may be stricter than this, I think an intelligent application of the existing policies already gives you what you want.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of [Mathematics][2]. There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" />

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.  We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Research-level mathematics — [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * General mathematics — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/); they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.

In other words, the type of problems seemed to always have the interpretation as source-sink shortest path problems, but I was not sure if it was correct.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only answer I have got so far is&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The answer is no. The simplest example off the top of my head is the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; longest substring of ones in a 0,1 string. The typical DP solution&#xD;&#xA;&gt; would be to use a 1D array and store the length of the longest&#xD;&#xA;&gt; substring up that includes the i-th character in the i-th coordinate. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I further asked:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; why is the example not able to be formulated into a source-sink&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shortest path problem in a network?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reply is:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I don't really see an easy way of doing it as a source-sink SPP. For&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the DP solution, the answer is obtained by scanning the array for the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; largest number.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am now still not sure how DP solves the longest substring of ones in a 0,1 string, and whether this problem can be interpreted as a source-sink shortest path problem.

The scope of cstheory is research-level. Questions that are at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate students are not part of the scope. There are other Q&amp;A sites which have a more general scope like [Math.SE][1] that would welcome questions from students.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Votes (down and up) are one of the main ways users express their opinion about the quality of a question and how interesting it is. A user may down vote a question if she/he thinks the question is off-topic or has other problems (e.g. unclear, not answerable in its current form, argumentative, not a real question, post to solicit opinion, ...).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;If you want to know why [your question](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8826/is-halting-that-hard-yes) is down voted you can ask for that in place of attacking other users. I will explain my down vote in more detail below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me that you are trying to find a way to get around the undecidability of halting problem. The halting problem (as it is defined in the literature) is undecidable and that is a mathematical theorem. Now one might be interested in decidable variations of halting problem. That is a well studied topic, and one can ask a research level question about that. There are also researchers working on these kind of problems who try to find ways to deal with undecidability in practice (mainly in formal methods community, but also in theoretical computer science). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand your question has no sign that you are familiar with the literature. I can tell that this is something a typical undergraduate student taking their first course in computability would ask. It is nice that a student would think about this kind of problems. But everything has a place and the place of this question is not cstheory. If you ask it on Math.SE you probably will not get any down votes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an analogy, it is completely fine and even encouraged that students ask questions like this in an undergraduate computability class from the instructor. Asking it in a research-level computability workshop will probably be unwelcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask a question about halting problem and show that you are familiar with the literature and understand the basics in the area, and the question is a real question (posting a question to see how others think about your idea about how to solve halting problem is not a real question) and is clearly stated (can be answered without much back-and-forth comments where others try to guess what you want to ask, which can be a sign that the question is not well-thought), then that can be on-topic and I would guess would not receive any down votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ps:&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest that you take a look at the [this section of the FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq#questions-should-be-based-on-knowledge-sharing-not-on-shirking) and also the pages linked there. Following those suggestions would increase the chance that your questions are well perceived by the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq" />

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.  It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the [faq](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(_Added in revision 5_: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the [built-in FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq), not to the [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science).  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → [built-in FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq) → [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science) → [What kind of questions are too basic?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What should we do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&#xD;&#xA;2. &lt;del&gt;On [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/), too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and [it certainly confuses some users](https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/), but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- See a [related FAQ entry](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235) and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added in revision 4:_ Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.  Here is the description of the close reason “too localized”:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of the suggestion 2 above is that it is at least possible to argue that too elementary questions fall into the third group (and possibly also the second group) of this description.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni ([meta profile][1], [site profile][2]). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've asked [one question][3], and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack" />

I know that you don't want the mix of questions to become too elementary and put off the serious researchers.  It would be nice to be able to segregate the more basic questions from the advanced, but given that the theory community is small, there probably aren't enough people to support two separate StackExchange sites.  And hopefully some of the people asking basic questions will eventually be asking (and answering) more advanced stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's one little idea that might be workable: ask that anyone posting a question that could be considered undergrad-level material to tag it with something like &quot;intro&quot;.

In fact, Lance's question starts with &quot;From a physics perspective...&quot;. The question is also phrased to include &quot;What is information?&quot; and &quot;What is volume?&quot; (this second question  standing on its own does not qualify in any way as being on-topic).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am of course aware of the tenable connection between information theory and physics (in fact I mentioned this connection as one of my reasons for pursuing higher studies in TCS in my answer to [this question][1] posted before Lance's question). I hope this dispels to some degree the cargo-cult physics googling caricature of my comment that Charles Stewart presented here; Namely, I am familiar with the topic, but not so familiar that I would hazard to claim any sort of expertise - notice I have never tried to post an authoritative sounding answer to any related question. I hope my comment under Lance's question sounded exactly as handwave-y as it was: it was a motion that was supposed to communicate &quot;you should really talk to physicist because we are by no means the right community to define 'volume' or 'the amount of information in a physical system.'&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My main thesis would have two parts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Lance's question, while having connections to TCS, doesn't not constitute a good TCS question. It is not refined enough, it has not been distilled enough, to qualify a good TCS answer. For example, it would be better if the question identified some problem with using bits of precision as a basis of information in a physical system, and asked how this might be resolved. Also that, if we were to admit the question as being relevant to TCS, we should reject it on the grounds that quick reference searches are enough to provide background material and links to better coverage.&#xD;&#xA; - That the question got more upvotes than it deserved because of the name of the author of the question.

Contact a number of researchers in areas that are not active on the site, and tell them that their area is not active on the site and ask them to help us in getting more questions and answers in those areas. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. We can also hold special weeks where every user is encouraged to ask a question (even very basic ones from people unfamiliar with those areas, you have attended a talk in some area and you have a very basic question you haven't asked) in a specific area, if we get enough question in those areas, they may generate enough interest to make those areas active.

Moreover, I feel that the topic “applications of the fuzzy logic to pattern recognition” is more specific than “quantum computing” (I may be biased here; quantum computing is my field of research, and I am not familiar with either the fuzzy logic or pattern recognition).  I have a difficulty justifying the difference of people’s responses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added_:  Just to make sure, the question on quantum computing projects I am talking about is _not_ the same as a [more recent question about how to write a research proposal on applications of evolutionary algorithms to quantum computing](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1715/long-term-project-on-quantum-computing).

It would be nice if the moderators here would avoid migrating low-quality questions to CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I noticed recently a few low-quality questions that were migrated to the Computer Science Stack Exchange (CS.SE) site.  I would suggest that we avoid doing that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question, and on-topic for CS.SE, I definitely encourage you to migrate to CS.SE.  For instance, if it is not research-level but would be a reasonable question, migrating to CS.SE is a great idea.  Go for it!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question for CS.SE -- please don't migrate it to CS.SE.  If it's a bad question, just close it, don't migrate it.  Please don't make CS.SE a dumping ground for bad questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question -- well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, don't let that stop you from migrating.  If it's just the English, we can edit it over at CS.SE.  But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear -- I personally don't think it should be migrated over to CS.SE&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One recent example: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038.  In my opinion, that question shouldn't have been migrated to CS.SE.  It is not a good fit for the Computer Science Stack Exchange.  The question does not show evidence of effort.  It asks a question about a topic that is already covered by reference questions at CS.SE, with no evidence that the question-asker was aware of that.  These issues are not something that those of us at CS.SE can fix through simple edits to the question.  Of course, that's just one example.  I don't mean to pick on that one or focus on that one too much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kaveh explains that the CS.SE admins specifically requested that &quot;badly written&quot; questions are still OK to migrate to CS.SE.  I didn't realize that!  That explains a lot.  Perhaps that's something we should discuss.  I'm not sure whether &quot;badly written&quot; refers to the English/grammar, or to more fundamental issues (like whether it's a good question, whether it is well-researched, whether it is on-topic and focused and detailed and not a duplicate).  If the former, I agree, English/grammar problems should not be a barrier to migration.  If the latter, well, I guess I might have a slight difference of opinion with the CS.SE admins -- maybe that's something we need to discuss on CS.meta, instead of here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I certainly don't mean to imply that this is a huge, systemic problem that requires major changes to migration, and I don't mean to imply the moderators here are doing anything wrong (I think the moderators are doing a great job!).  Overall I think the process is generally working well.  I just wanted to suggest a minor refinement that I think might make things work better on CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1086/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1285/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1507/5038&#xD;&#xA;* [Do we want CSTheory.SE to migrate bad questions over here?](https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/691/755)" />

However, in most cases, questions tagged as [np-completeness] ask whether a certain problem which is trivially in NP is NP-complete or not.  Therefore, the main point is whether the problem is NP-hard or not.  On the other hand, some of the questions tagged as [np-hardness] are about search or optimization problems, which are themselves not in NP (according to the standard definition of NP as a class of decision problems).  But the difference between search/optimization problems and decision problems is a technicality in most cases and should not be important in the classification of questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions tagged as [np-hardness] ask about problems which are not known to be in NP.

We should not merge them into [np-completeness] because there are rare cases where the [np-completeness] tag would be awkward.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If merging the two into the [np-hardness] tag is not desired, an alternative suggestion is to merge them into a new tag, for example [np-complete-np-hard].

Active participants range from advanced undergraduates to well-established scientists. Currently the majority of participants are graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but the number of senior researchers active within the site is growing quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though [cs.theory.stackexchange.com](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) is only two months old, it can already boast of 2,000 registered users, 700 answered questions, and -- perhaps most exciting -- [new research collaborations among computer scientists](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/when-should-you-say-what-you-know/2362#2362) who otherwise might never have realized that they were working on related problems.  The atmosphere of the site is a bit like a corridor discussion at a conference: researchers discuss and explain both folklore and the newest results, in a format that can be read at leisure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions and their answers are highly technical, but the answers from experts are often more than just answers; they contain insights that are not available in papers or textbooks.  For example, a student who requested a &quot;common sense&quot; explanation for how padding arguments related to complexity class separations received [an intuitive answer from Russell Impagliazzo](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/why-do-complexity-classes-translate-upwards-and-not-downwards/2453#2453); Scott Aaronson summarized the [state-of-the-art in non-relativizing techniques][6]; Jeff Erickson explained why [the real RAM model is preferred in computational geometry][7]; and a student who asked whether the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom number generator relativizes received [an answer from Noam Nisan](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2236/does-nisans-pseudo-random-generator-relativize/2239#2239).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions have also generated new proofs: Peter Shor gave a [reduction from Max-Cut with positive weights to a constant-factor approximation for the version of the problem with negative weights][8]; Jukka Suomela demonstrated that [DOMINATING SET remains NP-complete for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3][9]; Sariel Har-Peled showed that [Hamiltonicity is NP-complete for k-regular graphs for any fixed k][10]; and Per Vognsen outlined a [proof for the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma using projective geometry][11].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to specific technical questions, participants have asked for more general advice from the community, such as [how to referee papers][12], possible [Master's thesis topics in automata theory](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/979/automata-theory-formal-language-thesis-topic), pointers to [recent purely functional data structures][13], suggestions for an [inspirational talk about theoretical computer science][14], and [how to find a job](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2215/how-to-get-a-job).  The site is a place for the larger theory community to come together.  The overall scope of the site is **research-level theoretical computer science, broadly defined**.  _Note that homework questions are not allowed on the site_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Everyone with a research interest in theoretical computer science is welcome to create an account.  We encourage participation using real names -- and almost everybody does this -- but it's not required.  Participation costs nothing, and takes as little or as much time as you choose. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Site Origin and Structure###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the founding members of [cstheory.stackexchange.com](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) participated in discussion of a proposed solution to the P/NP problem that spanned multiple blogs, led to the creation of wiki pages, and brought together researchers in disparate fields from around the world.  This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a [&quot;Meta&quot; area][15], for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Who runs the site?###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now.

I've tried to be as constructive as I can, given that I don't have a concrete idea on how to change it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It currently (Rev 10) reads: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Perhaps you're a computer scientist wondering [how much the Axiom of Choice matters to the theorems you study and prove](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1923/which-interesting-theorems-in-tcs-rely-on-the-axiom-of-choice-or-alternatively).  Perhaps you're a mathematician who needs [a top expert to explain what &quot;randomness&quot; really means in computability and complexity](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1263/truly-random-number-generator-turing-computable).  Perhaps you need [a list of problems that can be used to show polynomial-time hardness results, to strengthen your toolkit of reductions](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1284/problems-that-can-be-used-to-show-polynomial-time-hardness-results/).  Or perhaps you think a problem might be open -- but might just as easily be solved -- so [you'd like to ask a group of professionals what they think](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2379/refereed-games-with-uncorrelated-semi-private-coins).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have comments on each of the four examples in this opening paragraph:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(1) I'd guess that most computer scientists have *not* wondered how the Axiom of Choice matters to CS; most probably just think that it doesn't. The fact that we got a really interesting answer to the contrary is a success story for the site.  One of the things I enjoy most about the site is that I have learned interesting answers to questions I never would have thought to ask, not because they are not in my area, but because I always assumed the answer was trivial or never had occasion to think about them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(2) Are there any non-CS-mathematicians who read SIGACT News?  (Indeed, even the OP for that question is chair of his CS department, in addition to a joint appointment in the Math Dept.) Laurent Beinvenu's answer to that question was *great*, but I think we need to rephrase how we're selling it in this opening paragraph. I'm not sure the following is a good way, but I'll just note that his answer is like a short tutorial/primer on ML-randomness (basically all it lacks is the most recent results), something which might appear in a publication like SIGACT News. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the amount of effort to write such a thing for such a publication is much greater than on this site, and would take several months to go through the publication pipeline, if it happened at all.  Here we got a direct line to the source, and we got just the part of the tutorial we wanted, right away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(3) A list of problems that can be used to show polynomial-time hardness results seems like a great resource for graduate students and people entering that area of research fresh, but I imagine experts in that area are familiar enough with the literature to have produced much of the entire list on their own. I think it's important that the paragraph clearly recognizes the correct audience for such a question, as is already done in the first two examples.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, maybe (but I'm not sure) a good way to think about it is that such a list is like part of a short tutorial that might appear in a publication like SIGACT News, but with a much lower barrier to creation (but still high quality).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(4) The last example is great.  It's universal: it applies to graduate students *and experts*, everyone has had an experience where they wished they could do exactly this.  And on this site, you can. It's a great pre-punch-line for this paragraph (the punchline, of course, being &quot;Visit tcs.se&quot; on the next line)." />

For example, [here](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2461/interactive-proofs-for-levels-of-the-polynomial-hierarchy) is a question that is open, not demarcated with the 'open-problem' tag but that meets the criteria I listed above.

We should be able to vet questions before they are migrated to cstheory, for example when a moderator on a sending site migrates a questions it should not become migrated at once but should become a possible migratable question on the receiving site visible only to moderators and high reputation users (say +2K) for a limited time (say one week) and if it receives enough migration votes on the receiving site or if a moderator on the receiving site decides that it is on-topic and suitable for the site then the migration is completed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another possibility is to allow high reputation users vote to unmigrate a migrated question back to the original site (with a note to the migrating moderator about it so they will be more careful in their feature migration decisions)." />

As you know, SE has changed the Community Wiki policy and now only moderators can make a question a CW. Community Wiki has 2 main effects:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The question becomes owned by community, the original OP does not gain reputation,&#xD;&#xA;2. The required reputation to edit drops to 100,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and a side effect:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. The answers posted after a questions becomes a Community Wiki become Community Wiki automatically, i.e. the answers are owned by community, (but answers posted before the question becoming CW don't).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These three effects are not always correlated and there are cases that one wants to have one of these three but not the other two, e.g. the owner does not want to earn reputation but wants the users answering the question to earn reputation for their answers. So it seems to me that SE is mixing too many things in one concept and that is the main reason for many issues we had and have with CW policy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robin brought up the idea that we should make the non-CW answers to a CW question CW also. I have a problem with answers becoming CW when the question becomes CW because sometimes the answers deserve to earn reputation, but in the current situation it makes sense, if the answers need to be CW then the previous ones also need to be CW, on the other hand a user might not have answered a question if it was a CW question so I don't know what is the right thing to do here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see three clear reasons for making a question a CW (and it would be nice to add other reasons to this list):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. OP doesn't want to earn reputation (for some reason),&#xD;&#xA;2. OP wants to allow others to edit,&#xD;&#xA;3. the question is a ranking list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example I think a question like [this][1] and [this][2] should be CW but the answers should not be and the users answering them should earn reputation for their answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another issue is that the new policy is not clear on what we should do when we think a question or answer needs to be CW, I used to flag some posts for moderator attention but don't do it any more because I now think it is not very nice to suggest someone else question or answer should be CW to the moderators, so I have decided to go with a softer way of adding comments like &quot;I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have an proposal that I think might solve some issues and would like to hear what others think about it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In general the question or answer should be made CW only on the request of the owner (with some exceptions, see below), other users that think the post should be CW can leave a non-abusive comment like: &quot;nice answer, I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot; and up-vote only if/when it becomes CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exceptions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. the OP is a drive-by user and does not reply to the answers or comments after considerable time,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. some clear cases like: a ranking list. These should be explicitly included in the policy,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. other special situations where the moderators have strong reasons for making a question CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think about this proposal (agree, disagree, opinions, improvements and suggestions, ...) and CW in general? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**ps:**&#xD;&#xA;Another minor issue about CW is its (lack of) effect on badges, it seems strange that a user does not earn reputation but does earn badges for CW posts, e.g. I should not have earned a badges for [these answers](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/174/major-unsolved-problems-in-theoretical-computer-science/218#218).

Things will become much easier if we just pretend that questions cannot be made CW, and I suspect that we will not lose much by doing so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually I have never understood when to use community wiki (CW).  As you wrote, making a question CW has several effects, and I cannot see when we want to (1) give up reputation points, (2) make it easy to edit and (3) propagate the same effect to answers at the same time.  For example, I have never understood why big-list questions should be CW.

I wanted to separate it out from the other discussion, though.  I'd like to start by contrasting two questions, one on StackOverflow, and one here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, consider [How do I move the turtle in LOGO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1003841/how-do-i-move-the-turtle-in-logo), especially the history of edits and closes.  A simple question with a simple answer, and, instead, it was repeatedly edited and closed by users who decided the question was fake, had nothing to do with programming, etc.  In this case, the asker was someone who wasn't leaving, so he clarified his position and eventually got an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now consider the question about [disproving the Church-Turing thesis](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/88/what-would-it-mean-to-disprove-church-turing-thesis).  In this case, I answered the question, it received a lot of upvotes, and was accepted by the asker.  However, in the months since that occurred, some of the finest minds in TCS have commented or answered that question, both explaining how wrong I was, and also sharing deep insights about the issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question I'd like people to consider is: Would you rather have a culture of arrogance, in which anyone with enough rep can decide, &quot;Get real, you couldn't possibly be Donald Knuth, I'm closing your question,&quot; or would you rather have a culture in which leading researchers feel comfortable adding to a question where a fairly high rep user already posted an accepted answer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question behind this question is, &quot;Why is there such a difference in the two sites?&quot;  I believe the answer lies in StackOverflow's fallacious belief that crowdsourcing is the best way to arrive at truth.  This may be the case for questions at the level of an Ask-the-Audience game show -- or even most in-the-trenches programming questions -- but when literally only a handful of people know the answer, and there are plenty of ways to deceive yourself that you solved the problem (when you didn't), the method breaks down.  Crowdsourcing does not produce truth; it only produces *an answer that nobody feels like debating any more*.  This lack of debate might arise because everyone is convinced, or because the few people who know the real answer don't see the point of participating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suresh has made the point well that a one-size-fits-all perspective about StackExchange sites does not work.  However, I believe this argument does not go far enough.  The quality of questions and answers on StackOverflow would *significantly increase* if that site were broken into smaller pieces.  If quality in answers is the priority, it should be harder than it currently is for C# experts to answer functional programming questions, as one example.  Rather than the academic caution that we have inherited -- not wanting to brashly say things about a field we know little about -- the StackOverflow model encourages people who get lots and lots of upvotes to answer questions in areas where there is little participation, because they'll get even more upvotes, and the people who know better aren't around, or don't want to start confrontation by calling them out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, on cstheory, if someone created a profile named &quot;Donald Knuth&quot; or &quot;Avi Wigderson&quot; or whoever, and asked a question, I bet everyone would be careful to treat that user like any other, and to treat the question professionally.  The content of the question is what is important, not &quot;making sure we're not being trolled&quot; or whatever.  I believe this attitude comes from our common belief in the importance of truth, as something beyond, &quot;Good enough,&quot; or, &quot;This is what works.&quot;  Moving forward, I think the most important thing to bear in mind is that we want to attract members who share that understanding of the primacy of mathematical truth.  That's what we share with others interested in theory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;StackExchange, of course, gets revenue as a function of number-of-hits, so I am sure they see the high traffic of StackOverflow as a great thing that should not be messed with by separating out pieces of it.  Ok, fine.  But if they are interested in more crossover among disciplines, they could, for example, institute a tag system that crosses sites.  So, for example, a chemist posting on biostar about the degree sequence of a molecular graph could see questions about degree sequences on cstheory -- and the graph theorist here could see a potential application for the theoretical work!  Personally, I would *love* such a feature.  I'd like to ask Joel Spolsky and Robert Cartaino to work on *that*, instead of asking us to adapt to the StackOverflow site model, which would not serve us well." />

We now have a cstheory blog at cstheory.blogoverflow.com ! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We'll have to feel out the best way to use it to augment the discussions on the site. To start with, we are happy to announce two editors-in-chief of the blog. [Joe Fitzsimons][1] and [Aaron Sterling][2] have agreed to manage content on the blog, and among their roles will be soliciting posts from YOU to place there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which brings me to the second point. As currently envisaged (Joe and Aaron will have more to say on this I'm sure), anyone who's interested can contribute to the blog, and this is how it would work:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. you write a draft on the site&#xD;&#xA; 2. An editor reviews it&#xD;&#xA; 3. It gets posted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Presumably as time goes on, some contributors might get direct posting rights - we can see how that goes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what should you do now ? Sign up if you're interested in contributing. To do so, post your name and/or a link to your profile, which hopefully has an email address, in an answer below, and one of the admins (Kaveh or myself) will create an account for you. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once that's done, you can start writing drafts. And I'm sure the editors will nudge people as well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have questions about the format, content styles etc, please create a new meta question and link it here. Let's keep this post primarily for signups. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/204/joe-fitzsimons&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/30/aaron-sterling" />

Such &quot;proofs&quot; tend to be exactly as good as the assumptions they rest on---in other words, as what they take words like &quot;computation&quot; or &quot;efficient computation&quot; to mean.

How could you modify &quot;specific axioms from paper&quot; to allow quantum computing?

The main kind of questions for cstheory are questions *in* TCS. soft-questions can be acceptable (and I have expressed my opinion previously that I support including them in the scope), but they are not the main kind of questions for cstheory (e.g. they are acceptable as long as they are infrequent). soft-questions should be held to higher standards than non-subjective questions in TCS.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. I don't like when users who haven't contributed to cstheory drop by from time to time and ask subjective and controversial questions. IMO, these users should first contribute to cstheory by asking and answering questions *in* TCS before asking subjective and possibly controversial questions *about* TCS. soft-question about TCS which are not in the scope (e.g. if the answer to the question is so trivial that any researchers or graduate student in TCS would know the answer like [this](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/9226/whats-a-good-news-source-for-computer-science)) then they are not suitable for cstheory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4.

Unfortunately this is not an evidence for a time machine.  This question was migrated from another site, and it was posted in 2008 in the original site.

The scope of cstheory is research-level. Questions that are at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate students are not part of the scope. There are other Q&amp;A sites which have a more general scope like [Math.SE][1] that would welcome questions from students.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Votes (down and up) are one of the main ways users express their opinion about the quality of a question and how interesting it is. A user may down vote a question if she/he thinks the question is off-topic or has other problems (e.g. unclear, not answerable in its current form, argumentative, not a real question, post to solicit opinion, ...).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;If you want to know why [your question](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8826/is-halting-that-hard-yes) is down voted you can ask for that in place of attacking other users. I will explain my down vote in more detail below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me that you are trying to find a way to get around the undecidability of halting problem. The halting problem (as it is defined in the literature) is undecidable and that is a mathematical theorem. Now one might be interested in decidable variations of halting problem. That is a well studied topic, and one can ask a research level question about that. There are also researchers working on these kind of problems who try to find ways to deal with undecidability in practice (mainly in formal methods community, but also in theoretical computer science). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand your question has no sign that you are familiar with the literature. I can tell that this is something a typical undergraduate student taking their first course in computability would ask. It is nice that a student would think about this kind of problems. But everything has a place and the place of this question is not cstheory. If you ask it on Math.SE you probably will not get any down votes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an analogy, it is completely fine and even encouraged that students ask questions like this in an undergraduate computability class from the instructor. Asking it in a research-level computability workshop will probably be unwelcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask a question about halting problem and show that you are familiar with the literature and understand the basics in the area, and the question is a real question (posting a question to see how others think about your idea about how to solve halting problem is not a real question) and is clearly stated (can be answered without much back-and-forth comments where others try to guess what you want to ask, which can be a sign that the question is not well-thought), then that can be on-topic and I would guess would not receive any down votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ps:&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest that you take a look at the [this section of the FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq#questions-should-be-based-on-knowledge-sharing-not-on-shirking) and also the pages linked there.

Scott Aaronson in his blog sometimes uses the scenario of super-intelligent alien beings having a discussion with us to emphasise the universality of certain notions in mathematics or computer science. This post felt like a very scaled-down but realistic form of that thought experiment.

Every answer discusses a specific sub-area of computational logic and consists of three paragraphs.

The second paragraph highlights some results in the field and techniques used to prove those results. The third paragraph mentions current directions and open problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Proposal 2*. We make a &quot;table of contents&quot; answer that lists different sub-areas of computational logic and hyperlinks to the different answers. Anyone can add to this list, and then add a separate answer for the area mentioned.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Proposal 3.* If the OP agrees, we modify the original question a bit to make explicit the structure desired for answers. (We could also do this in the ToC answer I suggest in Proposal 2, but people might not read other answers before replying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I feel such an advanced research summary would be a valuable resource for the future reference, and that obtaining such a survey via our user base would be effective.

However, the answers posted there are not satisfactory because they are unclear or they are not answers to the exact question being asked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there a good way to to ask for a clearer or better answer to an old question?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following are some ways, but they have their own disadvantages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One thing he/she can do is to post a question nevertheless, probably stating why the existing answers are not satisfactory.  However, from answerer’s viewpoint, I think that it is better to post a new answer to the _old_ question or edit an answer to the old question rather than posting an answer to the new question, because it is the same question and it is just a better answer.  Therefore, I think that in this situation, the new question should be closed as a duplicate for the old question.  Now from asker’s viewpoint, it is awkward (or possibly even abusive) to post a question knowing that it will be closed as a duplicate of the old question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing is to write a comment to the old question or its answer.  But if the user is new, he/she cannot post a comment.  In addition, if the user who made that post is no longer active, chances that anyone notices the comment are slim.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing is to edit something in the old question or propose an edit.  If the user has enough rep points, he/she can edit a post.  Add a tag or correct a typo or make some other harmless edit, and the question is bumped on the top page and it receives some attention.  Proposing an edit has one obstacle, but if the proposed edit is accepted, it has the same effect.  But either way, this sounds like an abusive or spam-like activity to me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing is to bring this up in chat room.  Problems are that it is usually not active, and that if the user is new, he/she cannot post a message in chat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing is bounty, but this requires some rep points.&#xD;&#xA;" />

But I think people have been too quick to label some questions as &quot;too elementary&quot;, when in fact they describe very real research-level questions.  For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [How are lower bounds for computational complexity proved?](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18372/111)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Roots of a polynomial](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18406/111)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In both cases, there is an undergraduate-level &quot;textbook&quot; answer.  (For the first question: Sorting requires $\Omega(n\log n)$ comparisons.  For the second question: Hilbert's 10th is undecidable.)  But if we look past those easy answers, these are legitimate research-level questions in theoretical computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Okay, but then how does one prove lower bounds for problems that can't be solved by comparison trees?  Or lower bounds bigger than $\Omega(n\log n)$ for problems solvable in polynomial time?  Or exponential lower bounds for NP-hard problems?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Okay, but then how does one actually find integer roots of polynomials in practice?  Are there effective algorithms for broad and interesting classes of polynomials?  Are there algorithms with provable approximation guarantees (for interesting classes of polynomials)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In both cases, the deeper question is likely not what the original poster intended.  (But StackExchange answers are for the entire community, not just for the original poster.  And why should we shy away from blowing the original poster's mind?)  And even if it were, the posts would require significant editing to bring the deeper question to the fore.

In the case of the above question, here's what my personal (i.e non-moderator) take is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* the question rambles terribly and doesn't really get to the point&#xD;&#xA;* the poster has a habit of writing questions and answers like this, and frequently gets downvoted/otherwise censured for such postings&#xD;&#xA;* But in this case, another user has suggested a concrete improvement that can be made, and there are a number of upvotes (and faves) for the question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the moderator role here is to help suggest modifications (especially since there appears to be a germ of substance in the question) and encourage the OP to make the changes (which I will note the OP has **not** done). As an individual, the moderator is free to downvote the post in its current form. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But as a community moderator, I prefer to do nothing rather than do something, and in this case I have to ask what the consequences are of doing nothing. Either the OP will fix the post or not. If not, it's quite likely that other members of the community will downvote the post and/or vote to close it. Or they might attempt to answer the question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;worst case scenario&quot; from my point of view might be that an ill-formed question sticks around for a while. But what is the downside of this ? The OP regularly posts ill-formed questions, and they get hammered ([about 2/3 of the questions posted][1] have a net negative score). Clearly the OP is not learning anything from the community view on their question formulation, but I don't see any evidence that these questions are affecting others, or reducing the quality of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Either way, there are sufficiently many options available to the community at large that I (as moderator) don't need to step in.

We have discussed previously (see [this](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1264/) and [this](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1395/)) that we are not going to require or even demand people to explain their votes. When I see a down-vote that I don't understand I politely comment that I don't understand it, but I think demanding an explanation or stating that there is no reason for the down-vote goes too far. It is not an abuse if people are using their votes in a way different from us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have argued a number of times that I am against counter-voting, that is voting to null the effect of another user's vote. Everyone has their own opinion. The total reflects the opinion of the community, it is not the job of any particular user to decide what the total should be. Counter-voting encourages other users to do the same and use their votes to null votes in place of express their opinion about the question. Each vote is a manifestation of some user's opinion and if we respect their opinions then we should respect their votes even when we disagree with them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is more productive if we comment and explain why we think it is a suitable and interesting question in place of just asking others why they have down-voted the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this particular case, I see several possible reasons for a down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Formating: It is using an image in place of writing the expression which I think has been one of the reasons people down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Content: The questions seems to simply ask how to calculate some expression for some particular values. It seems to ask how to apply a method explained in a paper in a particular case in practice. It is too localized and it doesn't seem to be a _research-level_ question in _theoretical_ computer science. It is also unclear what is the trouble the OP is facing in calculating the expression.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask me I think we are being too open right now (I guess it is partly because people get bored that there are not as many questions as they would like) to questions which should not be here and are more suitable for CS.SE.

And [this](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18903/how-would-the-use-of-ternary-computers-change-complexity-of-algorithms) is clearly not-research level in my opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=close&amp;daterange=last30days" />

So we expect people to ask only questions that they *really* care about (if you really care about a question you will spend time and effort on it, and the effort correlates with the quality of the question). We expect people to spend time doing their part before asking others for help, e.g. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **You have tried to answer your question yourself first (Google, Wikipedia, Complexity Zoo, etc.) before asking it on cstheory,**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **You have thought about the question enough to be able to formulate it clearly and in a way that can be answered, you know what you are looking for,**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **You have spent time to formulate your question using the language and terminology of theoretical computer scientists and following the norms of their community,**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **You have spend time to write your question in a clear and easy to understand format for theoretical computer scientists.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;FAQ contains more [tips about writing better questions](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq#tips-about-writing-better-questions)." />

([meta.MO] might be a better place to ask about it as MO is older and considerably larger than cstheory.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We do get spam and low quality answers from time to time but they are generally removed or heavily down-voted. There is also the fact that like other popular CW questions (it is [our policy](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/759/the-new-community-wiki-policy) that big-list questions must be turned into CW) we protect popular big-list questions. This adds a barrier for adding new answers. I think it is a reasonable barrier, in a sense we are saying that these questions are special and potentially problematic so they are required to pass higher standards. To post an answer you have to first show that you are contributing positively in a sense before being able to post your answer to a big-list question. The same applies informally to big-list questions, i.e. they are expected to pass a higher standard of quality otherwise they get several down-votes and/or closed as too broad.

Gather statistics: In the past 90 days, there have been [6 migrations to and from CS Theory](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/posts/migrated/stats):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        cs.stackexchange.com          =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 4 (25% rejected)&#xD;&#xA;        datascience.stackexchange.com =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;        cstheory.stackexchange.com    =&gt; cs.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   This is underwhelming. It seems that in practice, people are pretty good about posting to CS when they have a non-research-level question. Just one question has been migrated away. It does not seem as if the moderators are being overwhelmed with migration flags. It's also instructive that there are few migrations the other direction. (A 25% rejection rate would be a red flag if it were not just one question.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I don't see a lot of evidence that this path is needed. Looking at the [close statistics](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/question-close-stats?daterange=last90days) it seems that the custom close reason that directs people to post to CS on their own is the prefered solution. 115 questions have been closed that way over the same time period. Now if the proportion _does_ shift toward migration and if those migrations are successful as a rule, we might have a reason to add this default path." />

While I try to judge this proposal on its own merit, it is likely that the time and energy I have invested in CS.SE influences me.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm afraid that broadening the scope in this way would destroy the existing community. A Stack Exchange site is defined by two things: the kind of questions it accepts, and the audience it attracts. Even though each question is in principle judged on its intrinsic merits, the long-term effect is to create a community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On this site, the community is centered around researchers in theoretical computer science. Participants tend to be researchers in TCS, researchers in other fields, or graduate students aspiring to become researchers. The participants who are welcomed are generally those who came with the expectation of participating in a community dominated by TCS researchers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not see a problem with allowing more applied questions. As long as academics and people who want to fit in with academics dominate the site, that isn't a problem. It may be difficult to bootstrap an applied CS community (it would have been a lot easier to do when the site was young), but if it works, it won't change the tone of the site, and if it fails, the site won't have changed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, opening the door to more basic questions means opening the door to a broader audience. This should be a carefully controlled process. In particular, I advise you not to try to draw on Stack Overflow as an audience base. A majority of Stack Overflow does not know or care what it means to be a scientist. The kind of people you would attract are those who now post on [Programmers](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/). If you attract those people, be prepared to moderate their content. And to moderate them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reacting to specific points in your proposal:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We now have a natural forum (cs.stackexchange.com) for the more &quot;basic&quot; algorithms questions, and the cstheory &quot;brand&quot; is well established as a 'research-only' venue. So we have an easy process to shunt questions that are obviously undergrad level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that CS.SE is not exclusively for basic questions. It is for questions at all level, ranging all the way from CS 101 homework to applied research (and even research in theory, but we suggest CSTheory.SE to the rare asker who comes with a theory question that seems to go unanswered because it is too hard).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; excluding questions from people who might be 'research-level' in a sub area but aren't experts in some other domain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From what I see (I admit to not following CSTheory.SE very closely), this already happens: as long as there's a feeling that peers are talking with peers, questions tend to be appreciated, left open and answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; creating the impression of an unfriendly site (which is a bigger problem in terms of maintaining the audience)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the community is doing an adequate job of retaining the audience it likes in and keeping the undesirables in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, while the current guidelines may be stricter than this, I think an intelligent application of the existing policies already gives you what you want.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Cool!  It seems like it would be a good experiment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The tricky bit is to select the criteria for which questions would be shown.  I can see two plausible possibilities:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Alternative 1: Have a set of tags which are eligible for this, e.g., algorithms, complexity-theory, computability, undecidability, etc.  Any question with vote total of 10+ and with at least one tag in the whitelist would then be eligible to be shown on CSTheory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; This might whittle down the list of questions to those that are related to theoretical computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; However, it has the problem that many of the questions selected in this way will not be research-level.  There are a lot of questions on CS.SE with 10+ votes that are not research-level questions in theoretical computer science, and they might be unwelcome on CSTheory.  Take a look at the [top questions on CS.SE](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes) sorted by vote total, or the [top questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/complexity-theory?sort=votes&amp;pageSize=50) and you'll see what I mean.  Only a small fraction of the highest-voted questions there would be a good fit for CSTheory; the majority would not be useful to display on CSTheory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; I looked at the top 50 highest-voted questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag.  All of them have a vote total of 10 or higher.  By my own highly personal assessment, about 10 of them look like they would be good to display on the CSTheory.SE front page.  The others don't look like great candidates (they are elementary, of narrow interest, or were about proving NP-hardness of a specific problem and the question has already been solved).  A 20% hit rate isn't great.  But this is my own personal taste, and others may differ.  I encourage readers to do their own count, see what they get, and post their own evaluation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Alternative 2: Allow moderators to select which questions are eligible for display in this way.  This could be indicated, for instance, via a moderator-only tag that's added to the question on CS.SE, which triggers it to be shown on CSTheory -- analogous to the &quot;featured&quot; tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; This would require some manual effort from moderators, but allows more control over which questions are displayed, and enables selecting questions which are research-level and which relate to theoretical computer science.  (A minor difficulty with using a special tag is that, if the question already has 5 tags, it may not be possible to add a 6th tag.)&#xD;&#xA;" />

See for example [this meta question about their scope][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My perception was that the site is for &quot;scientists doing science by heavy computations&quot;. But it seems that it might not be true anymore that there are questions about algorithms and distributed computing among other things. I am not saying that there is significant overlap right now (I haven't had time to go over the questions on the site) but I am now concerned about it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See also my discussion with Geoff (one of pro-term moderators) [here](https://scicomp.meta.stackexchange.com/a/176/207).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think we want to see another SE site covering a significant part of our scope (as crypto.se did and hit the number of crypto questions on cstheory, see [this](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tags/cr.crypto-security/topusers)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some question that I think we need to think about:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do you think there is a problem about the current scope of computational sciences site? Do we need to be concerned about this?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What distinguishes questions that are suitable for cstheory from those on computational sciences and vic versa on overlapping topics (like algorithms, distributed computing, ...)? Is there a significant overlap? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What should we do if there is a significant overlap between the two sites?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;As a side issue, I feel that we might have an even larger problem when the CS proposal launches if its scope is modified later in such a way that it contains cstheory, and I should say that [the current attitude of the SE team about the proposal description][4] is not comforting for me. As I said earlier, I support a math.se like version of CS, but I don't want it to start to significantly overlap with cstheory.

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.  It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the [faq](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(_Added in revision 5_: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the [built-in FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq), not to the [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science).  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → [built-in FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq) → [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science) → [What kind of questions are too basic?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What should we do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&#xD;&#xA;2. &lt;del&gt;On [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/), too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and [it certainly confuses some users](https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/), but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- See a [related FAQ entry](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235) and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added in revision 4:_ Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.  Here is the description of the close reason “too localized”:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of the suggestion 2 above is that it is at least possible to argue that too elementary questions fall into the third group (and possibly also the second group) of this description.&#xD;&#xA;" />

As you know, SE has changed the Community Wiki policy and now only moderators can make a question a CW. Community Wiki has 2 main effects:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The question becomes owned by community, the original OP does not gain reputation,&#xD;&#xA;2. The required reputation to edit drops to 100,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and a side effect:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. The answers posted after a questions becomes a Community Wiki become Community Wiki automatically, i.e. the answers are owned by community, (but answers posted before the question becoming CW don't).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These three effects are not always correlated and there are cases that one wants to have one of these three but not the other two, e.g. the owner does not want to earn reputation but wants the users answering the question to earn reputation for their answers. So it seems to me that SE is mixing too many things in one concept and that is the main reason for many issues we had and have with CW policy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robin brought up the idea that we should make the non-CW answers to a CW question CW also. I have a problem with answers becoming CW when the question becomes CW because sometimes the answers deserve to earn reputation, but in the current situation it makes sense, if the answers need to be CW then the previous ones also need to be CW, on the other hand a user might not have answered a question if it was a CW question so I don't know what is the right thing to do here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see three clear reasons for making a question a CW (and it would be nice to add other reasons to this list):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. OP doesn't want to earn reputation (for some reason),&#xD;&#xA;2. OP wants to allow others to edit,&#xD;&#xA;3. the question is a ranking list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example I think a question like [this][1] and [this][2] should be CW but the answers should not be and the users answering them should earn reputation for their answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another issue is that the new policy is not clear on what we should do when we think a question or answer needs to be CW, I used to flag some posts for moderator attention but don't do it any more because I now think it is not very nice to suggest someone else question or answer should be CW to the moderators, so I have decided to go with a softer way of adding comments like &quot;I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have an proposal that I think might solve some issues and would like to hear what others think about it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In general the question or answer should be made CW only on the request of the owner (with some exceptions, see below), other users that think the post should be CW can leave a non-abusive comment like: &quot;nice answer, I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot; and up-vote only if/when it becomes CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exceptions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. the OP is a drive-by user and does not reply to the answers or comments after considerable time,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. some clear cases like: a ranking list. These should be explicitly included in the policy,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. other special situations where the moderators have strong reasons for making a question CW.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think about this proposal (agree, disagree, opinions, improvements and suggestions, ...) and CW in general? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**ps:**&#xD;&#xA;Another minor issue about CW is its (lack of) effect on badges, it seems strange that a user does not earn reputation but does earn badges for CW posts, e.g. I should not have earned a badges for [these answers](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/174/major-unsolved-problems-in-theoretical-computer-science/218#218).

General, unfocused questions like, &quot;What would be a good topic?&quot; will be closed as off topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the objectives of this site is, &quot;Knowledge sharing, not shirking.&quot;  An essential part of research is to brainstorm project ideas that may or may not be sound, so it is reasonable to use this site to ask for feedback about a project idea you thought up but have not thoroughly investigated. On the other hand, if a project (or thesis) is supposed to be _yours_, it is inappropriate to leave all the conceptual work to others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Update**: Note that there are now suggested modifications to the policy in the answers. Please vote on them as well (the same rule applies for adoption). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/18440/what-algorithm-in-algebraic-geometry-should-i-work-on-implementing/" />

Of course this site is not the right place for asking for a topic of a PhD dissertation, but I think we should accept questions like &quot;How can I put 10 thousand lines of Java code to a good TCS-related cause?&quot; (or maybe better we could create a big list of ideas for such projects).

It is usually the case that such projects are used just once for 10 minutes by the grader, and then thrown away - so it's like a week of effort wasted (and there are also courses where for example four people write a project together for a year, so the outcome could potentially be really something very useful).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it would be a win-win situation if researchers would be able to put on this site (for example in a big-list topic) announcements like: &quot;I need a program searching for a small counterexample for some conjecture&quot; or &quot;I have an idea for an interesting game/simulation spreading the ideas of TCS, but I don't have the time to write it&quot; and so on; the students could then use these ideas for writing their projects, and if successful they would afterwards share the result with the scientific community." />

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.  We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Research-level mathematics — [Math Overflow](https://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * General mathematics — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/); they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor. &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Currently we have two separate lists of FAQs.

I don't think we are yet on course to be a successful Q&amp;A site for a few reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. We have no users who I would call names to conjure with.  This matters for any site: e.g., SO has many active users who are highly recognised experts for a large number of topics, and the SX folk think that this is essential to SOs success and will be essential to the sites coming through the SX beta phase. For academic Q&amp;A sites, as opposed to problem-solving sites I think this is even more important.  How important has Terence Tao's endorsement of MO been to that site's success?  The other two beta sites I've participated in, math.SX and tex.SX, had done far better by their 10th day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. We have a lack of high reputation users.  We don't have any 1k+ reputation users at all, so apart from the SX moderators, we have no-one who can edit weak questions, let alone access the moderation tools. It takes five 500+ users to close a question without moderator actions; we have 8.  We have only 23x 250+ users who can retag.  To some extent, this is a fact of life about the early public beta stage, but other sites have done better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Very little interest has been shown, or effort put into in the things that need to be done on meta to make the site a success.  Shane is our distinguished exception, Suresh has put in some effort, as well.  Besides these two, we have a list of fairly undifferentiated potential moderators: I haven't seen a whole lot of indication as to why one 500+ user would make a better moderator than another.  Work on the FAQ is nonexistent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, interesting questions have been asked and answered, we've got a pretty clear idea of our scope, and it's early days.

I wanted to separate it out from the other discussion, though.  I'd like to start by contrasting two questions, one on StackOverflow, and one here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, consider [How do I move the turtle in LOGO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1003841/how-do-i-move-the-turtle-in-logo), especially the history of edits and closes.  A simple question with a simple answer, and, instead, it was repeatedly edited and closed by users who decided the question was fake, had nothing to do with programming, etc.  In this case, the asker was someone who wasn't leaving, so he clarified his position and eventually got an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now consider the question about [disproving the Church-Turing thesis](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/88/what-would-it-mean-to-disprove-church-turing-thesis).  In this case, I answered the question, it received a lot of upvotes, and was accepted by the asker.  However, in the months since that occurred, some of the finest minds in TCS have commented or answered that question, both explaining how wrong I was, and also sharing deep insights about the issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question I'd like people to consider is: Would you rather have a culture of arrogance, in which anyone with enough rep can decide, &quot;Get real, you couldn't possibly be Donald Knuth, I'm closing your question,&quot; or would you rather have a culture in which leading researchers feel comfortable adding to a question where a fairly high rep user already posted an accepted answer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question behind this question is, &quot;Why is there such a difference in the two sites?&quot;  I believe the answer lies in StackOverflow's fallacious belief that crowdsourcing is the best way to arrive at truth.  This may be the case for questions at the level of an Ask-the-Audience game show -- or even most in-the-trenches programming questions -- but when literally only a handful of people know the answer, and there are plenty of ways to deceive yourself that you solved the problem (when you didn't), the method breaks down.  Crowdsourcing does not produce truth; it only produces *an answer that nobody feels like debating any more*.  This lack of debate might arise because everyone is convinced, or because the few people who know the real answer don't see the point of participating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Suresh has made the point well that a one-size-fits-all perspective about StackExchange sites does not work.  However, I believe this argument does not go far enough.  The quality of questions and answers on StackOverflow would *significantly increase* if that site were broken into smaller pieces.  If quality in answers is the priority, it should be harder than it currently is for C# experts to answer functional programming questions, as one example.  Rather than the academic caution that we have inherited -- not wanting to brashly say things about a field we know little about -- the StackOverflow model encourages people who get lots and lots of upvotes to answer questions in areas where there is little participation, because they'll get even more upvotes, and the people who know better aren't around, or don't want to start confrontation by calling them out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, on cstheory, if someone created a profile named &quot;Donald Knuth&quot; or &quot;Avi Wigderson&quot; or whoever, and asked a question, I bet everyone would be careful to treat that user like any other, and to treat the question professionally.  The content of the question is what is important, not &quot;making sure we're not being trolled&quot; or whatever.  I believe this attitude comes from our common belief in the importance of truth, as something beyond, &quot;Good enough,&quot; or, &quot;This is what works.&quot;  Moving forward, I think the most important thing to bear in mind is that we want to attract members who share that understanding of the primacy of mathematical truth.  That's what we share with others interested in theory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;StackExchange, of course, gets revenue as a function of number-of-hits, so I am sure they see the high traffic of StackOverflow as a great thing that should not be messed with by separating out pieces of it.  Ok, fine.  But if they are interested in more crossover among disciplines, they could, for example, institute a tag system that crosses sites.  So, for example, a chemist posting on biostar about the degree sequence of a molecular graph could see questions about degree sequences on cstheory -- and the graph theorist here could see a potential application for the theoretical work!  Personally, I would *love* such a feature.  I'd like to ask Joel Spolsky and Robert Cartaino to work on *that*, instead of asking us to adapt to the StackOverflow site model, which would not serve us well." />

We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be &quot;research-level&quot; roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.'s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student. It does not include questions at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate course/textbook homework/exercise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  **Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##My question is not a research-level question in TCS, where can I ask it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * General Computer Science — [Computer Science - Stack Exchange](https://cs.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Mathematics (including *theoretical* CS) — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Research-level Mathematics — [Math Overflow](https://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA; * Social and Professional Academic Issues — [Academia - Stack Exchange](https://academia.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Artificial Intelligence — [Meta Optimize](http://metaoptimize.com/qa/)&#xD;&#xA; * Statistics and Data Mining — [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Applied Cryptography and Security — [Crypto - Stack Exchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Computation used in Science and Engineering — [Computational Science - Stack Exchange](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Questions about this site — [Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange - Meta][1]&#xD;&#xA; * Other — check the list of sites on [Stack Exchange Network](http://stackexchange.com/sites)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking&#xD;&#xA;You should only post questions you're actually seriously thinking about.

The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.

However, as [explained previously](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2989/2017-moderator-election-we-need-more-candidates), in order for an election to proceed to voting phases it is required that there is at least one more candidate than there are spaces remaining in the election. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is important for a variety of reasons. The first is that it allows the election process to proceed in a way that allows candidates to be evaluated before being elected. It also serves to indicate that there are enough people in the community who are willing to handle the responsibilities of overseeing moderation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Theoretical Computer Science is not a site that's particularly in danger of low moderation. There's a healthy number of regular users across most reputation brackets who remain active on the site, still handling general moderation tasks.  The flag load itself isn't particularly large, and the current moderation team has expressed that they aren't overwhelmed by it. However, only one of the current moderators is highly active - while this is sufficient for the current flag load, it is healthier for the site to have multiple active moderators, not only to split even the small loads but also to handle situations where one of the moderators may have more pressing matters to attend.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It could be that now is just not a good time to have hosted an election for this site. The winter holidays are coming up soon, as well, which will mess up with future election timings, so we'll most likely look at some elections coming into the new year. " />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA; - If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2993" />

Why do you want to be a moderator for the cstheory stackexchange community?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd like to gain a deeper understanding of (a) theoretical computer science and (b) the StackExchange system of sites. Also it seems like it should be fairly easy to do a reasonable job. I have [&gt;15K rep on MathOverflow][1] so am pretty familiar with SE sites.

Do you lean towards keeping all comments as a record of what has transpired? Do you learn towards deleting old comments that are no longer making a major contribution? What approach will you take?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some easy cases: if a comment is just pointing out a mistake and that has already been fixed, then the comment is probably no longer needed. Also, if a comment no longer makes sense because related comments have already been deleted, it should make sense to delete. Moreover, if someone goes out of their way and flags a comment like &quot;Thanks!&quot; as no longer needed, I'd tend to go along with that. On the other hand, comments are often substantial and should be kept.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;3.

How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The user should receive some friendly hints that they are being problematic. If that doesn't help I would discuss with other moderators and then there is the possibility of a temporary suspension.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;5. How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;f it seemed very unreasonable to me I would probably discuss it with the other moderator; if only borderline I'd just let it go.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;6.

Should moderators stay inactive as long as the self-moderation of the community works well?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I feel that moderators should never be inactive.  They should always be active members who contribute to the community and regularly read recent questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That being said, I also feel that moderators should only use their special privileges when it's necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;4. How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would first identify whether (1) the comments are inappropriate, (2) the flags are inappropriate, or (3) users are being inappropriate towards each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When something looks clearly inappropriate, I would honestly explain why the comment or flag was inappropriate either directly or via comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;5. How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Depending on the situation, I would either:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(1) Leave it closed and trust the other moderator's judgement&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(2) Reopen it and include a note for why it was reopened&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(3) Contact the other moderator directly to resolve the issue&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;6. In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that moderators should do the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(1) Flag, Tag, Edit, Review, Resolve Issues&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(2) When necessary, get involved with community engagement promoting positive behavior on the platform.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;7. A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having the diamond next to my name means that I should act in a way that promotes positive behavior on the platform.  Really, regardless of whether or not I have a diamond next to my name, I should act in a way that promotes positive behavior on the platform.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;8. In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't ask the most questions or post the most answers.  But, I read through questions and answers on a daily basis and I regularly comment.  My presence and comments support the mission and goals of our community.

A few of them include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Top banner is shorter in height, so some artwork has to be adjusted along with some logos.&#xD;&#xA;- Left Navigation is active everywhere (but can be collapsed into a menu by visiting your site preferences - [instructions here][1]).&#xD;&#xA;- Responsive layout is active, which lets the site adjust as browser widths change - no side scrolling (some pages haven't been updated, yet, though). For now, if you prefer the scrolling, you can disable this by clicking the &quot;disable responsiveness&quot; link in the footer.&#xD;&#xA;- Many site elements including tags and voting arrows are standardized across the network.&#xD;&#xA;- Link underlining is active. In an effort to make links more visible, they are now being underlined.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have concerns or issues regarding the left nav or the overall approach we are taking to theming, then [this Meta Stack Exchange post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310908/live-left-nav-new-theming-and-responsiveness) is the right place for feedback. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I mentioned earlier, there are some unique design elements like voting arrows and tags that are being standardized in this process. Keeping these custom elements makes our ability to maintain the sites too complex and, while we're very sad to see them go, we're in a difficult position of needing to make the site designs work together so that we can continue to address feature requests and bugs that will make your Q&amp;A experience better. This is addressed in a [Meta Stack Exchange post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314799/why-we-initiated-the-latest-round-of-design-changes-and-the-role-of-meta) if you want more detail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What new themes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're like, &quot;What the heck are you talking about?&quot;, then you should read the Meta Stack Exchange post entitled [Rollout of new network site themes](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312365/rollout-of-new-network-site-themes) (and maybe the posts it links to for the full background).

And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of **Community Promotion Ads**! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What are Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - the site's twitter account&#xD;&#xA; - cool events or conferences&#xD;&#xA; - anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal is for future visitors to find out about *the stuff your community deems important*. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are *relevant to your own community's interests*, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we reset the ads every year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answers you post to this question _must_ conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All answers should be in the exact form of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;           [1]: http://image-url&#xD;&#xA;           [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Please **do not add anything else to the body of the post**. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The question must always be tagged with the magic [meta-tag:community-ads] tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Image requirements&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&#xD;&#xA; - Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&#xD;&#xA; - Must be GIF or PNG&#xD;&#xA; - No animated GIFs&#xD;&#xA; - Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&#xD;&#xA; - If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Score Threshold&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a **minimum score threshold** an answer must meet (currently **6**) before it will be shown on the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/3033" />

Sasho raised one question and one answer on his first comment: he was not sure why a particular part of some paper is correct and he was thinking that paper answers the question. Then I spent time to look at that paper and first I explained why that part is correct then asked why Sasho thinks that answers the question. Then Sasho understand his mistake and I don't know why, he or someone else removed his comment and then he answered me. Then I just upvoted his comment to say I'm agree with you. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I looked back at the question, I've noticed my comment has been removed. I think I didn't do that, unless unexpectedly I pressed the delete button. I'm wondering why someone should flag that comment or remove it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally do not delete my own comments when someone provides a constructive answer to me, because, that answer might be helpful for others in the future. However, even if someone removes his own comment why should a constructive answer to that comment be deleted? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the aforementioned case, even if after deletion of the first comment, someone doesn't understand what I'm answering, could ask it in a new comment." />

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115&quot;&gt;my previous question here on Meta&lt;/a&gt;, you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&quot;&gt;relevant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&quot;&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, a technical consideration: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another point that I've read in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&quot;&gt;some postings and comments here&lt;/a&gt; is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&quot;&gt;first mentioned in a comment here&lt;/a&gt;, some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="403" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:19:18.947" LastActivityDate="2010-08-25T22:09:30.680" CommentCount="9" />

I don't think we are yet on course to be a successful Q&amp;amp;A site for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have no users who I would call names to conjure with.  This matters for any site: e.g., SO has many active users who are highly recognised experts for a large number of topics, and the SX folk think that this is essential to SOs success and will be essential to the sites coming through the SX beta phase. For academic Q&amp;amp;A sites, as opposed to problem-solving sites I think this is even more important.  How important has Terence Tao's endorsement of MO been to that site's success?  The other two beta sites I've participated in, math.SX and tex.SX, had done far better by their 10th day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a lack of high reputation users.  We don't have any 1k+ reputation users at all, so apart from the SX moderators, we have no-one who can edit weak questions, let alone access the moderation tools. It takes five 500+ users to close a question without moderator actions; we have 8.  We have only 23x 250+ users who can retag.  To some extent, this is a fact of life about the early public beta stage, but other sites have done better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very little interest has been shown, or effort put into in the things that need to be done on meta to make the site a success.  Shane is our distinguished exception, Suresh has put in some effort, as well.  Besides these two, we have a list of fairly undifferentiated potential moderators: I haven't seen a whole lot of indication as to why one 500+ user would make a better moderator than another.  Work on the FAQ is nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, interesting questions have been asked and answered, we've got a pretty clear idea of our scope, and it's early days.

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&quot;&gt;meta profile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&quot;&gt;site profile&lt;/a&gt;). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack&quot;&gt;one question&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="403" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.560" LastActivityDate="2010-08-26T10:19:34.057" CommentCount="4" />

As someone who hasn't done graduate coursework in TCS, I find the CW/big-list questions very helpful.

I know that you don't want the mix of questions to become too elementary and put off the serious researchers.  It would be nice to be able to segregate the more basic questions from the advanced, but given that the theory community is small, there probably aren't enough people to support two separate StackExchange sites.  And hopefully some of the people asking basic questions will eventually be asking (and answering) more advanced stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's one little idea that might be workable: ask that anyone posting a question that could be considered undergrad-level material to tag it with something like &quot;intro&quot;.  Then anyone who doesn't want that stuff cluttering up their view could add the intro tag to their ignore filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think over time the mix of questions is going to include more like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/34/how-hard-is-unshuffling-a-string&quot;&gt;Jeff Erickson's&lt;/a&gt;, and this will become a less sensitive issue.  (By the way, has Bill Gasarch visited here yet?  He's posted some questions in the past on the CC blog that would be great for this site.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="184" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.610" LastActivityDate="2010-08-27T05:50:21.217" CommentCount="2" />

A wrong answer isn't an &quot;answer&quot; per se, and a detailed discussion won't fit in a non-nested comment thread.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The question: how can the CSTheory Q&amp;amp;A&#xA;  format better be used to support these&#xA;  kinds of parallel group investigations&#xA;  into problems?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One idea is to adopt the convention that &quot;answers&quot; to open questions are to be regarded as a discussion of possible approaches, rather than literal answers or partial answers to the question, then to encourage development of these approaches in the comments.  The downside is that these comments are not nested.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is to fork new questions concerning particular avenues of inquiry with links back to the parent question, perhaps with a dedicated &quot;subproblem&quot; tag; this might lead to a messy proliferation of subquestions.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Has any better format been discovered for collaborative investigation of open problems on other StackExchange sites, in particular, MO?  Are there other features in StackExchange we can activate to support this process?

It is a combined answer to the questions asked in both threads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other question, which reads &quot;Are specific questions about Theorem X in paper Y fine?&quot; actually covers two types of questions from posters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Type 1: Questions like &quot;How does one reach eq 3.14 from eq 3.15 in paper X, page Y? I tried the following ... but it didn't work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think most people would agree that these questions are appropriate for this site. The other type of question is the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Type 2: &quot;How does the proof of Theorem 3 in [citation] handle the case of disconnected graphs? I don't see how it works for that case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question might be pointing out a genuine error in a paper. But then again it might just be something the poster did not understand. What I want to say is that it is often hard to tell whether there is a mistake/confusion/non-understanding on your part, or an error in the paper. These correspond to type 1 and 2 questions respectively. If the poster is not able to distinguish between the two types of questions, and if we make it a policy to only allow Type 1 questions and not Type 2, this will be hard for posters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would a solution like the following work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We allow both type of questions. Questions of type 1 are handled as they usually are by the community.

When in doubt, do not mark a question CW – this can always be changed later.  A crucial technical point: any answers made to a CW question will themselves be CW.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often, a question that seems like it should be CW can be modified to be more direct and focused, thus avoiding the need for the tag. For example, the seemingly CW question &quot;What are the key papers in topic X&quot; can often be reworded as the more focused &quot;What I should start reading when studying topic X&quot;.

If &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; do not care about a question, either no one really cares or those who care can ask a better question.

If you really care about a question, the first thing to do should not be posting the question on a website, but trying to solve it by yourself.  This includes looking up literature, formulating it from different angles, considering small cases, special cases and/or variations, and so on; in short, what you normally do to solve a problem.  If you do not want to think about the question by yourself, ask yourself whether you really care about the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that you must not ask a question unless you have proved that you cannot answer it by yourself (which is obviously impossible).

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.  It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq&quot;&gt;faq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Added in revision 5&lt;/em&gt;: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq&quot;&gt;built-in FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, not to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science&quot;&gt;FAQ on Meta&lt;/a&gt;.  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq&quot;&gt;built-in FAQ&lt;/a&gt; → &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science&quot;&gt;FAQ on Meta&lt;/a&gt; → &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235&quot;&gt;What kind of questions are too basic?&lt;/a&gt;  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What should we do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/&quot;&gt;MathOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/&quot;&gt;it certainly confuses some users&lt;/a&gt;, but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235&quot;&gt;related FAQ entry&lt;/a&gt; and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added in revision 4:&lt;/em&gt; Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.  Here is the description of the close reason “too localized”:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point of the suggestion 2 above is that it is at least possible to argue that too elementary questions fall into the third group (and possibly also the second group) of this description.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:57:54.527" LastActivityDate="2010-11-10T18:20:01.380" Title="The reason to close too elementary questions" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;close-reasons&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="13" />

It seems to me that cstheory is the perfect place to ask about whether some concept has an existing crisp formulation.  Previous questions in this vein have included asking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/668/is-there-a-complexity-theory-analogue-of-rices-theorem-in-computability-theory&quot;&gt;something in the spirit of Rice's theorem in complexity theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/399/analogs-of-compressed-sensing&quot;&gt;my own question on analogs for compressed sensing&lt;/a&gt;.  Information theory is most definitely a part of theoretical computer science, and asking about whether the concept of volume, borrowed from physics, can be suitably formalized or not in an information theoretic sense is undeniably a valid one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, while I'm all for being more strict about soft questions, I feel that being pedantic about the scope of technical questions is going to be a big turn-off to some people.  cstheory is not supposed to be an elite club or something.  It's the virtual equivalent to a coffee break in a conference.  And Fortnow's question would certainly make for interesting conversation there.

I also feel the need to defend my position, and what I believe to be true about the relevance of Lance's question in context of this StackExchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with Robin under the comments that the question is a good physics question. In fact, Lance's question starts with &quot;From a physics perspective...&quot;. The question is also phrased to include &quot;What is information?&quot; and &quot;What is volume?&quot; (this second question  standing on its own does not qualify in any way as being on-topic).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am of course aware of the tenable connection between information theory and physics (in fact I mentioned this connection as one of my reasons for pursuing higher studies in TCS in my answer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1562/why-go-to-theoretical-computer-science-research&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; posted before Lance's question). I hope this dispels to some degree the cargo-cult physics googling caricature of my comment that Charles Stewart presented here; Namely, I am familiar with the topic, but not so familiar that I would hazard to claim any sort of expertise - notice I have never tried to post an authoritative sounding answer to any related question. I hope my comment under Lance's question sounded exactly as handwave-y as it was: it was a motion that was supposed to communicate &quot;you should really talk to physicist because we are by no means the right community to define 'volume' or 'the amount of information in a physical system.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My main thesis would have two parts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lance's question, while having connections to TCS, doesn't not constitute a good TCS question. It is not refined enough, it has not been distilled enough, to qualify a good TCS answer. For example, it would be better if the question identified some problem with using bits of precision as a basis of information in a physical system, and asked how this might be resolved. Also that, if we were to admit the question as being relevant to TCS, we should reject it on the grounds that quick reference searches are enough to provide background material and links to better coverage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That the question got more upvotes than it deserved because of the name of the author of the question. This question rapidly gathered upvotes, and in fact is currently ranked higher than some very strong TCS questions (for example this one &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1257/properties-of-random-directed-graphs-with-fixed-out-degree&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out that the answers to the question, from authors I respect and am sure have a great deal of domain knowledge, did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; amount to more than what can be found with a quick Google search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="Ross Snider" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.560" LastActivityDate="2010-09-23T17:53:55.960" CommentCount="0" />

In one respect, things are going fairly well. Our traffic is steadily increasing: from an early number of around 2500 visits/day, we are now at 3200 visits/day. We also have nearly 1500 registered users (part of this is no doubt some reddit love we got for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/whats-new-in-purely-functional-data-structures-since-okasaki&quot;&gt;a post on functional data structures&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet, I think our numbers overestimate the true penetration of the site within the theoryCS community at large. Here's an experiment I did:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Estimate the fraction of users with a&#xA;  reputation in the range $(1, 101) \cup&#xA;&amp;gt; [102, \infty)$, and compare this to the fraction of MO users in the range $(1, \infty)$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rationale for this is that merely signing up gets you a reputation score of 1, or 101 if you come in via the SE system. So that score doesn't reflect any actual involvement. MO on the other hand is an SE 1.0 site, and so they don't have the 101 bonus. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While in one respect this is an unfair comparison, because MO has been around a lot longer, it's not entirely unfair because we're only comparing ratios here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;TCS: roughly 20%&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  MO: roughly 40%  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(I did a crude approximation by looking&#xA;  at number of &lt;em&gt;pages&lt;/em&gt; of users, because&#xA;  I have a life :))&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this might suggest that our relatively large user numbers (relative to this stage in the beta) is an illusion, and so we need to work more at getting people in the community to participate.

I do not have an answer, but here is what I thought about this specific question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, I agree with you that the asker was just asking for a broad literature search to get accustomed to a field, and the asker has not shown the evidence that he/she has tried.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I see some inconsistency when I compare this question to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/710/quantum-computing-project-ideas&quot;&gt;the question asking for ideas of graduation projects about quantum computing&lt;/a&gt;, which has been perceived positively.  One is about the literature search and the other is about project proposals, but this difference does not seem important (if anything, asking for the literature is &lt;em&gt;more specific&lt;/em&gt;).  Note that the question about quantum computing projects does not show any evidence of prior efforts, either.  Moreover, I feel that the topic “applications of the fuzzy logic to pattern recognition” is more specific than “quantum computing” (I may be biased here; quantum computing is my field of research, and I am not familiar with either the fuzzy logic or pattern recognition).  I have a difficulty justifying the difference of people’s responses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added&lt;/em&gt;:  Just to make sure, the question on quantum computing projects I am talking about is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1715/long-term-project-on-quantum-computing&quot;&gt;more recent question about how to write a research proposal on applications of evolutionary algorithms to quantum computing&lt;/a&gt;.

I guess that Suresh already told the decision to Stack Overflow, and I do not know if it is possible or desirable to take it back.  (&lt;em&gt;Added&lt;/em&gt;: The domain name CSTheory.org was registered by Stack Overflow on August 26.  &lt;del&gt;While I am sure that they can afford some number of unused domain names, I do not know if it is the right thing to ask them to buy another; it sounds irresponsible to me.&lt;/del&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, I am afraid that canceling the concluded poll sets a bad example.  This poll was done according to a procedure.  If this poll was canceled, polls in the future will not look serious any more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, while a name is important and a good name adds value to the website, I do not think that it is critical for the success of the website.  What is critical is, needless to say, good content and good community.  We should be done with the debate on website name and domain name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(More on the third point: Honestly speaking, I think that the name MathOverflow is far from a good name.  It only makes sense to those who know Stack Overflow, and the relation to TeX no longer makes sense because questions about TeX are no longer allowed there (in other words, they chose a name based on an element which was only tangentially related to the topic of the website).  However, as long as the content is good, these negative facts do not matter, at least to me.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It must have been surprising to some people that the name “CSTheory.org” was supported by most people.

After all, it is a question about cooking, not in the theoretical computer science.  But this question is clearly asking for an algorithm.  Although its goal is not to compute any mathematical objects and it is usually called a recipe, these do not mean that it is not an algorithm.  “It cannot be implemented on computers or Turing machines” does not sound like a good reason that it is not an algorithm, either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Well,” you might say, “even if the question is about algorithms, it is too vague for a question in the theoretical computer science.  How do you define ‘pumpkin fries,’ ‘crispy’ and ‘soft’?  Oh, and you speak of the outside and inside.  Do you mean that pumpkin fries lie in a topological space?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if we think this way, it starts to sound as if we should close it as “not a real question” or “subjective and argumentative,” not as off topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am still pretty sure that the question &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; off topic, but I find it more difficult than I thought to define when a question is about algorithms, especially because I believe that it is correct to say that a cooking recipe is an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;.

I removed the [ds.algorithms] tag from it and voted to close it as off topic, and it soon got closed.  But I have just realized that the question &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; asking for an algorithm.

We are drawing lines about what is appropriate too strictly. We are being too conservative, the default position should be trusting decisions made by other users. If there is a disagreement, if the OP comes back and says I want this removed for some reasons, then we can discuss it, but as long as there is not a conflict, we should be very liberal about what users can do. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are we going to do if a user copies a deleted answer and posts it? Are we going to down vote it? Are we going to delete it? What if a number of users undelete a post. The system permits other users to undelete posts, even if it is deleted by the OP. Are we going to punish the users for undeleting it? Are we going to delete it again?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also don't see any reason legally or ethically for not copying an answer. What is the ethical principle that is being violated? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMHO, copying answers is completely compatible with the philosophy of the site. Let me quote a part of FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Other people can edit my stuff?!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Like Wikipedia, this site is collaboratively edited, and all edits are tracked. &lt;strong&gt;If you are not comfortable with the idea of your questions and answers being edited by other trusted users, this may not be the site for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is clear about the philosophy of SE. If you are not happy about copying answers, I respect your view. But if you are saying that it is inappropriate or unethical and/or if you are trying to draw lines too strictly about how other users or moderators should act, and about what is appropriate and what is not, sorry, but I don't agree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit 10/26/2010&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with Tsuyoshi that there is not a need to agree on everything, i.e. I agree with Tsuyoshi to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My main point here is on how conservative we should be on what trusted users/moderators can do.&lt;/strong&gt; My view, as I wrote above, is that we should trust decisions made by others and be very liberal, we don't need to discuss every decision made by others, unless there is a conflict/disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me also make it clear that there is a difference between being nice to others and what is ethical. An action can be considered &quot;not being nice to others&quot;, but still don't violate any ethical principles. Being nice is boarder than being ethical (in this context).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let me return to the particular case of this question.&#xA;My sentence about the ethical principle being violated is in the context of our discussion, i.e. the appropriate use of &lt;em&gt;this site&lt;/em&gt;. The argument, if I understood it correctly, is that we should respect the decision made by OP about deleting their post, and I guess this is based on the view that &lt;em&gt;OP own what they have posted&lt;/em&gt;. I am not sure I agree with this. Again if I understood the philosophy of the site correctly, it is very similar to Wikipedia, and it is a collaborative effort. If you have posted something, others can modify, edit, or even copy-and-post it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some discussion on why it is not clear to me if a post is owned by OP, specially a CW post:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. When someone posts an answer/questions, it means that other users are probably going to avoid posting similar content,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II. People vote for the answer,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;III. Other answers may refer to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Removing a post can also be considered as not respecting the questioner, other user answering the question, and the votes given to the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if it is CW, i.e. &lt;em&gt;community wiki&lt;/em&gt;, it is more involved. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IV. CW answers are owned by community, they are edited by other users, and removing a post can cause even more problems in this case. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assume that we have a CW question about what is the most famous problem in TCS, and someone posts &quot;$P$ vs $NP$&quot;, and of course receive lots of votes, after a few months the OP goes back and removes the answer. Assume that no one notices this. Think how it would look like if someone from outside or a new user reads the question and does not see an &quot;$P$ vs $NP$&quot; answer?! And even if another users posts it again, how many times do other uses have to vote for the same answer? Should we expect them to vote once every time someone removes it and someone else reposts an answer which is essentially the same?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest you read this post: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5221/what-can-cause-a-post-to-be-deleted-and-what-does-that-actually-mean/5222#5222&quot;&gt;What can cause a post to be deleted, and what does that actually mean?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, this part:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When can't I delete my own post?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You can't delete your answer if it has been accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You can't delete your question if it has more than two answers, if an answer has a score &gt;= 2, or it has been closed less than 48 hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are restrictions on when an answer can be removed by OP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summery, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I. it is not clear to me that OP owns what they post, specially CW posts,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;II. deleting a good highly-voted post by OP (without stating any reasons) can also be considered disrespect towards other users, and may cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just to make it clear, I agree that we should be nice to others, and if the OP complains about undeleting their post (and states some reasons for it) I would support the OP, but IMO, the default position should be that &quot;posts can be undeleted by others, even if OP have removed it&quot;, specially if they are good and highly-voted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="186" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:29:37.593" LastActivityDate="2010-10-26T08:00:48.400" CommentCount="4" />

But then, should we not also close questions like these:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2396/counting-the-number-of-hamiltonian-cycles-in-cubic-hamiltonian-graphs&quot;&gt;Counting the number of Hamiltonian cycles in cubic Hamiltonian graphs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2373/complexity-of-simplex-algorithm&quot;&gt;Complexity of simplex algorithm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My rationale: These and other questions that are phrased like &quot;What is best ... known?&quot; or &quot;Is there ...?&quot; are &quot;only&quot; a replacement for literature research. They do not pose a motivated, original problem or reflect that work has gone into finding an answer. One could say the one asking has not done his homework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course they are research level questions and therefore inherently more interesting -- and they offer a possibility for experts to show off (in a good way), other than undergrad homework problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I feel that a general rule of thumb for question scope should be found and that the negative approach (finding criteria for closing/rejecting) cannot go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, let us try to answer the following questions: What makes a question good?

Active participants range from advanced undergraduates to well-established scientists. Currently the majority of participants are graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but the number of senior researchers active within the site is growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;cs.theory.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; is only two months old, it can already boast of 2,000 registered users, 700 answered questions, and -- perhaps most exciting -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/when-should-you-say-what-you-know/2362#2362&quot;&gt;new research collaborations among computer scientists&lt;/a&gt; who otherwise might never have realized that they were working on related problems.

We encourage participation using real names -- and almost everybody does this -- but it's not required.  Participation costs nothing, and takes as little or as much time as you choose. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Site Origin and Structure&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the founding members of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;cstheory.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; participated in discussion of a proposed solution to the P/NP problem that spanned multiple blogs, led to the creation of wiki pages, and brought together researchers in disparate fields from around the world.  This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;&quot;Meta&quot; area&lt;/a&gt;, for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Who runs the site?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now.

The fact that we got a really interesting answer to the contrary is a success story for the site.  One of the things I enjoy most about the site is that I have learned interesting answers to questions I never would have thought to ask, not because they are not in my area, but because I always assumed the answer was trivial or never had occasion to think about them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) Are there any non-CS-mathematicians who read SIGACT News?  (Indeed, even the OP for that question is chair of his CS department, in addition to a joint appointment in the Math Dept.) Laurent Beinvenu's answer to that question was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;, but I think we need to rephrase how we're selling it in this opening paragraph. I'm not sure the following is a good way, but I'll just note that his answer is like a short tutorial/primer on ML-randomness (basically all it lacks is the most recent results), something which might appear in a publication like SIGACT News. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the amount of effort to write such a thing for such a publication is much greater than on this site, and would take several months to go through the publication pipeline, if it happened at all.  Here we got a direct line to the source, and we got just the part of the tutorial we wanted, right away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) A list of problems that can be used to show polynomial-time hardness results seems like a great resource for graduate students and people entering that area of research fresh, but I imagine experts in that area are familiar enough with the literature to have produced much of the entire list on their own. I think it's important that the paragraph clearly recognizes the correct audience for such a question, as is already done in the first two examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, maybe (but I'm not sure) a good way to think about it is that such a list is like part of a short tutorial that might appear in a publication like SIGACT News, but with a much lower barrier to creation (but still high quality).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(4) The last example is great.  It's universal: it applies to graduate students &lt;em&gt;and experts&lt;/em&gt;, everyone has had an experience where they wished they could do exactly this.  And on this site, you can. It's a great pre-punch-line for this paragraph (the punchline, of course, being &quot;Visit tcs.se&quot; on the next line).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="129" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.610" LastActivityDate="2010-10-31T16:24:53.833" CommentCount="2" CommunityOwnedDate="2010-10-31T16:24:53.833" />

Therefore, I propose to merge [np-completeness] to [np-hardness].  Note the direction; I am proposing to make the &lt;em&gt;more popular tag&lt;/em&gt; a synonym for the &lt;em&gt;less popular tag&lt;/em&gt;, which is different from the usual proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that NP-completeness and NP-hardness are two different notions.  However, in most cases, questions tagged as [np-completeness] ask whether a certain problem which is trivially in NP is NP-complete or not.  Therefore, the main point is whether the problem is NP-hard or not.  On the other hand, some of the questions tagged as [np-hardness] are about search or optimization problems, which are themselves not in NP (according to the standard definition of NP as a class of decision problems).  But the difference between search/optimization problems and decision problems is a technicality in most cases and should not be important in the classification of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some questions tagged as [np-hardness] ask about problems which are not known to be in NP.  Therefore, merging in the other direction would make the tag awkward for some questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: It has reached +4 with 4 upvotes and 0 downvotes, but there are two negative comments.  What should I do?  Let me clarify my points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We should merge [np-completeness] and [np-hardness] into one tag because for most questions, their distinction depends not on the essence of a question but on a particular way a question is stated.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We should not merge them into [np-completeness] because there are rare cases where the [np-completeness] tag would be awkward.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If merging the two into the [np-hardness] tag is not desired, an alternative suggestion is to merge them into a new tag, for example [np-complete-np-hard].

I'm &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/our-designer-in-residence-jin-yang/&quot;&gt;Jin&lt;/a&gt;, and I'll be working on the designs for the Stack Exchange sites as they graduate from the beta phase. Each site will have its own unique theme that will reflect its topic. However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For my research on the design, I've been going through the type of questions asked on the site and your design ideas in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33/what-should-our-logo-be&quot;&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt; post.&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/GSYbD.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the Turing Machine and DFA suggestions. I think they represent the concept of TCS very well. For the logo, I normally make its shape to fit within a square dimension; this way it can be easily made into a favicon/apple touch icon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the overall design, I believe a clean look would work well, with a few details that have a hint of &quot;computery stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below is the design for the homepage. While it doesn't have all the site elements, it should give you a good idea of the overall look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(click to see full resolution version)&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wujRN.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/wujRN.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Below is the modified version based on your feedback from the original. I changed the logo to the DFA concept Suresh suggested. I've also updated the question title text from Courier to Palatino. I do think it will look good with the math formula text.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QiyWR.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QiyWR.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, for the title header I'm using the Turing Machine concept, and &quot;Σ&quot; as the logo. I'm using a faint water mark of a FSM in the background for pure decorative purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The body section is basically the same as the Beta Sketchy theme structure-wise.

I wanted to make one aesthetic suggestion, though: I think the title &quot;THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE&quot; can be made more appealing by using the Title-Case instead of UPPER-CASE: &quot;Theoretical Computer Science&quot;. A Turing tape does not necessarily hold upper-case symbols, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One more suggestion: In computer science, there's a notion of &lt;strong&gt;oracles&lt;/strong&gt;. Informally, they are functions that &quot;know&quot; the answer to some specified question, and can compute and return it in &lt;strong&gt;one step&lt;/strong&gt;. I think this concept can be used in the design; specifically when an expert (the oracle) answers a question. Specifically, I like the idea with up-voting/down-voting a question/answer. One can imagine the oracle concept replacing the &quot;pen tips&quot; in the TeX design:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcBty.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="873" LastActivityDate="2010-11-29T10:05:58.600" CommentCount="9" />

The uppercase sigma is strongly related to discrete mathematics (because the symbol is used for summation), and it is true that theoretical computer science uses discrete mathematics a lot, but theoretical computer science is not the same as discrete mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, without a better alternative, the uppercase sigma is an acceptable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33/what-should-our-logo-be/314#314&quot;&gt;DFA idea&lt;/a&gt; as is used in Suresh’s publicity materials, but it will not be recognizable in a 16×16-pixel favicon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Typewriter font&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the use of typewriter font in the website title written on a tape of a Turing machine.  On the other hand, as Suresh said, I am worried about the use of typewriter font in question titles, too, but for a different reason.  Some of the question titles are long, and typewriter font takes too much width.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not think that a mix of two fonts is bad by itself.  I am not sure if we want to use the same roman font in both question titles and question bodies just because they can contain MathJax math.  &lt;del&gt;In my (uneducated) opinion, question bodies are probably better in a roman font but question titles can be sans-serif.&lt;/del&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Edit: I removed the last sentence; see my reply to Jin in a comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" LastActivityDate="2010-11-30T11:49:50.503" CommentCount="4" />

As you know, SE has changed the Community Wiki policy and now only moderators can make a question a CW. Community Wiki has 2 main effects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The question becomes owned by community, the original OP does not gain reputation,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The required reputation to edit drops to 100,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and a side effect:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The answers posted after a questions becomes a Community Wiki become Community Wiki automatically, i.e. the answers are owned by community, (but answers posted before the question becoming CW don't).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These three effects are not always correlated and there are cases that one wants to have one of these three but not the other two, e.g. the owner does not want to earn reputation but wants the users answering the question to earn reputation for their answers. So it seems to me that SE is mixing too many things in one concept and that is the main reason for many issues we had and have with CW policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robin brought up the idea that we should make the non-CW answers to a CW question CW also. I have a problem with answers becoming CW when the question becomes CW because sometimes the answers deserve to earn reputation, but in the current situation it makes sense, if the answers need to be CW then the previous ones also need to be CW, on the other hand a user might not have answered a question if it was a CW question so I don't know what is the right thing to do here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see three clear reasons for making a question a CW (and it would be nice to add other reasons to this list):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OP doesn't want to earn reputation (for some reason),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OP wants to allow others to edit,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the question is a ranking list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example I think a question like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/45/what-are-good-references-to-understanding-the-proof-of-the-pcp-theorem&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2953/advice-on-good-research-practices&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; should be CW but the answers should not be and the users answering them should earn reputation for their answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that the new policy is not clear on what we should do when we think a question or answer needs to be CW, I used to flag some posts for moderator attention but don't do it any more because I now think it is not very nice to suggest someone else question or answer should be CW to the moderators, so I have decided to go with a softer way of adding comments like &quot;I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have an proposal that I think might solve some issues and would like to hear what others think about it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In general the question or answer should be made CW only on the request of the owner (with some exceptions, see below), other users that think the post should be CW can leave a non-abusive comment like: &quot;nice answer, I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot; and up-vote only if/when it becomes CW.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the OP is a drive-by user and does not reply to the answers or comments after considerable time,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;some clear cases like: a ranking list. These should be explicitly included in the policy,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;other special situations where the moderators have strong reasons for making a question CW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think about this proposal (agree, disagree, opinions, improvements and suggestions, ...) and CW in general? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ps:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Another minor issue about CW is its (lack of) effect on badges, it seems strange that a user does not earn reputation but does earn badges for CW posts, e.g. I should not have earned a badges for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/174/major-unsolved-problems-in-theoretical-computer-science/218#218&quot;&gt;these answers&lt;/a&gt;.

(I admit that I had flagged several big-list questions for moderator attention to make them CW, following the existing protocol without thinking why.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added&lt;/em&gt;: As you pointed out in a comment, it is sometimes explained that big-list questions should be CW because votes on answers reflect how good the items mentioned in the answers are rather than how good the answers themselves are.  However, honestly speaking, I doubt that this explanation ultimately makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many useful answers (no matter whether the question is a big-list question or not) are simply links to some external items, and in my opinion the answers pointing to good items in a useful way are good.  (One of the examples which I always think of is &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/716/computational-complexity-of-the-3-partition-problem-with-distinct-numbers/758#758&quot;&gt;Serge Gaspers’s answer&lt;/a&gt; to my first question on CS Theory Stack Exchange.  The essential part of the answer is a single reference, and it was extremely useful for me.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not like to talk about reputation points as if they are anything important, but if reputation points are worth talking about, then someone who pointed out a good item in a useful way should gain reputation points in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.610" LastActivityDate="2010-12-06T02:49:06.337" CommentCount="10" />

However, if the edit is within five minutes from the original post or the last edit, it does not become a new revision but simply overwrites the last revision.

This might be a project for a class, a Master's Thesis, or even the focus of a doctoral dissertation.

I would like to know the current ratio for MO. If we think this is a problem we should try to encourage people to provide more answers to the questions from different perspectives, e.g. by putting an entry in the FAQ explaining it that it is good and in fact &lt;em&gt;encouraged&lt;/em&gt; to post new answers even for questions which have accepted answers (assuming that the new answer is good and adds some new information).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried searching for various combinations of words related to the site.

The official explanation for this restriction, which I cannot find where I saw for now, is “Allowing unlimited undoing would open up the possibility of gaming the system.”  Namely, if you want your answer to be voted up, you could vote down the other answers so that your answer will be shown on the top of the page (because the other answers have now negative score) and lazy users will read only your answer and upvote it.  The downside of this strategy is that you lose 1 rep point every time you cast a downvote, but if you can undo the votes, you can cancel your downvotes after a week or so when no one cares what happens in a question which does not appear on the top page.  Moreover, canceling the downvotes hides the evidence that you have cast many downvotes (the number of upvotes and downvotes you have cast is available on your profile page).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many (seemingly silly) restrictions on Stack Exchange websites like this originate from the same logic of preventing gaming the system.  I guess that these restrictions came from the real experience by the admins at Stack Overflow Internet Services, Inc., on Stack Overflow and other sites which have longer history than ours.  I appreciate the fact that the admins put their experiences to form the whole Stack Exchange network.  However, I am worried by their general tendency of overreacting to the fear that someone may game the system.  I believe that different communities have different priorities and that earning the rep points is not considered to be as important in cstheory.stackexchange.com as in more popular sites such as Stack Overflow.

We welcome &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; questions in &lt;em&gt;theoretical computer science&lt;/em&gt; (TCS).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Research-level mathematics — &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/&quot;&gt;Math Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Programming — &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;General mathematics — &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematics - Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;; they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.

IMO there exist a not so well visible but still solid border between Computer Science and something that I call Computational Science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is mostly a part of mathematics dealing with algorithms, data structures, complexities, languages and stuff. This is what mostly happens here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second is an interdisciplinary movement of people using computer computations to make science; this group is rather united by common practical problems and methods than a common interest. Those are people that make all kinds of simulations, like computational physicists, computational chemists, computational biologists, computational sociologists, ..., meteorologists, economists, visual/physical effect makers, various kinds of engineers; people processing data, like various data scientists, bioinformaticians, chemoinformaticians, again economists, machine teachers, text miners, image and sound wizards and the rest of data-AI; finally all soft computing, robotics and steering theory debris.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is some overlap between the two, mostly in areas of numerics, BLAS and some &quot;golden&quot; algorithms like Smith-Waterman (C-nal Scientists spent thousands of CPU hours in such so they would use any fast working black-box C-ter Scientists would gave them). Outside this C-nal Scientist don't care much about theoretical aspects of their algorithms.

I wanted to separate it out from the other discussion, though.  I'd like to start by contrasting two questions, one on StackOverflow, and one here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1003841/how-do-i-move-the-turtle-in-logo&quot;&gt;How do I move the turtle in LOGO&lt;/a&gt;, especially the history of edits and closes.  A simple question with a simple answer, and, instead, it was repeatedly edited and closed by users who decided the question was fake, had nothing to do with programming, etc.  In this case, the asker was someone who wasn't leaving, so he clarified his position and eventually got an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now consider the question about &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/88/what-would-it-mean-to-disprove-church-turing-thesis&quot;&gt;disproving the Church-Turing thesis&lt;/a&gt;.  In this case, I answered the question, it received a lot of upvotes, and was accepted by the asker.  However, in the months since that occurred, some of the finest minds in TCS have commented or answered that question, both explaining how wrong I was, and also sharing deep insights about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A question I'd like people to consider is: Would you rather have a culture of arrogance, in which anyone with enough rep can decide, &quot;Get real, you couldn't possibly be Donald Knuth, I'm closing your question,&quot; or would you rather have a culture in which leading researchers feel comfortable adding to a question where a fairly high rep user already posted an accepted answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question behind this question is, &quot;Why is there such a difference in the two sites?&quot;  I believe the answer lies in StackOverflow's fallacious belief that crowdsourcing is the best way to arrive at truth.  This may be the case for questions at the level of an Ask-the-Audience game show -- or even most in-the-trenches programming questions -- but when literally only a handful of people know the answer, and there are plenty of ways to deceive yourself that you solved the problem (when you didn't), the method breaks down.  Crowdsourcing does not produce truth; it only produces &lt;em&gt;an answer that nobody feels like debating any more&lt;/em&gt;.  This lack of debate might arise because everyone is convinced, or because the few people who know the real answer don't see the point of participating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suresh has made the point well that a one-size-fits-all perspective about StackExchange sites does not work.  However, I believe this argument does not go far enough.  The quality of questions and answers on StackOverflow would &lt;em&gt;significantly increase&lt;/em&gt; if that site were broken into smaller pieces.  If quality in answers is the priority, it should be harder than it currently is for C# experts to answer functional programming questions, as one example.  Rather than the academic caution that we have inherited -- not wanting to brashly say things about a field we know little about -- the StackOverflow model encourages people who get lots and lots of upvotes to answer questions in areas where there is little participation, because they'll get even more upvotes, and the people who know better aren't around, or don't want to start confrontation by calling them out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, on cstheory, if someone created a profile named &quot;Donald Knuth&quot; or &quot;Avi Wigderson&quot; or whoever, and asked a question, I bet everyone would be careful to treat that user like any other, and to treat the question professionally.  The content of the question is what is important, not &quot;making sure we're not being trolled&quot; or whatever.  I believe this attitude comes from our common belief in the importance of truth, as something beyond, &quot;Good enough,&quot; or, &quot;This is what works.&quot;  Moving forward, I think the most important thing to bear in mind is that we want to attract members who share that understanding of the primacy of mathematical truth.  That's what we share with others interested in theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;StackExchange, of course, gets revenue as a function of number-of-hits, so I am sure they see the high traffic of StackOverflow as a great thing that should not be messed with by separating out pieces of it.  Ok, fine.  But if they are interested in more crossover among disciplines, they could, for example, institute a tag system that crosses sites.  So, for example, a chemist posting on biostar about the degree sequence of a molecular graph could see questions about degree sequences on cstheory -- and the graph theorist here could see a potential application for the theoretical work!  Personally, I would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; such a feature.  I'd like to ask Joel Spolsky and Robert Cartaino to work on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, instead of asking us to adapt to the StackOverflow site model, which would not serve us well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="30" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T11:33:34.517" LastActivityDate="2011-02-10T17:06:23.427" Title="On the Difference between Crowdsourced Answers and Mathematical Truth" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="3" FavoriteCount="0" />

One major impediment is that the current software does not support such an idea, so the SE people would have to put in considerable effort to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea went as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I think it would be great to have a&#xA;  CS stackexchange site that had&#xA;  multiple &quot;forums&quot; (for the different&#xA;  fields of CS) like cstheory. The&#xA;  membership could be shared. The&#xA;  reputation points could transfer&#xA;  across the forums. But each site&#xA;  should have its own homepage which&#xA;  featured only its own questions - tags&#xA;  and filters are not nearly enough.&#xA;  Perhaps the featured bounty questions&#xA;  could be shared across forums, as&#xA;  could questions with very high scores.&#xA;  That way, we could see what exciting&#xA;  things are happening in the other&#xA;  fields and would be tempted to&#xA;  occasionally browse the other forums&#xA;  without their questions clogging the&#xA;  theory ones. This would increase the&#xA;  user base as users from all the forums&#xA;  would occasionally do some browsing&#xA;  and answering each others' questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The response seems to have been positive.  I am curious:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there support within the community for such a proposal (if done right)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assuming there is community support&lt;/em&gt;, is this something the people running StackExchange are willing to consider implementing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone see a downside?

Currently area tags are named in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The area tags which originate from &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;CoRR subject areas&lt;/a&gt; are named as &lt;code&gt;xx.description&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;xx&lt;/code&gt; is the coresponding CoRR subject area codes and &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; is the descriptive name of the area.  Examples are &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cr.crypto-security&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cr.crypto-security&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cr.crypto-security&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cg.comp-geom&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;cg.comp-geom&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;cg.comp-geom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ds.algorithms&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ds.algorithms&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ds.algorithms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ds.data-structures&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;ds.data-structures&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;ds.data-structures&lt;/a&gt;.  Note that some area tags deviate from the categorization in CoRR.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other area tags are labeled like usual tags.

Therefore tags look simply inconsistent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no advantage of having the corresponding CoRR subject area codes in the tags.  As I understand it, the only purpose of these codes is to indicate that they are area tags.  However, this is incomplete because not every area tag has a two-letter code.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that a more consistent naming is better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the Stack Exchange server had a functionality of showing area tags in a different color, we would not have to distinguish them by names.  Because it does not have such a functionality, it is better to distinguish area tags by names.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I propose the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;.  Remove the &lt;code&gt;xx.&lt;/code&gt; part from the area tags of the form &lt;code&gt;xx.description&lt;/code&gt; and instead add a fixed prefix to all the area tags.  As the fixed prefix, I suggest to use either &lt;code&gt;a.&lt;/code&gt; (for “area”) or just &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;.  [&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;: I removed the earlier suggestions &lt;code&gt;a:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; because it turned out that a colon cannot be used in tags.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" LastActivityDate="2011-03-01T20:40:08.750" Title="Use a consistent prefix to distinguish area tags instead of CoRR subject area codes" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;tags&gt;" AnswerCount="5" CommentCount="26" />

This is against the policy about not allowing questions about unpublished not-peer-reviewed approaches to open problems and crank-friendly topics. The OP states that this is equivalent to &quot;$\mathbf{P}$ vs. $\mathbf{NP}$&quot;, and therefore it falls under that policy and should be closed as &lt;strong&gt;off-topic&lt;/strong&gt;. The cosmetics like the way of phrasing the question are irrelevant.

Research-level questions can be asked on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This discussion has recently gained momentum on Area51; here are some links:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/612/two-level-model-mo-math-se-vs-one-level-model-so&quot;&gt;Two level model (MO/Math.SE) vs one level model (SO)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/630/what-problems-does-the-two-level-split-solve&quot;&gt;What problems does the two-level split solve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And even proposals like &lt;strong&gt;Beginner Theoretical Computer Science&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Computer Science&lt;/strong&gt; were  considered; but they were soon deleted/closed due to lack of support / misunderstanding that they are exact duplicates of other SE sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Support:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe that such proposals did not advertise themselves well. For instance, if I ever knew that they exist, I'd join them at once. This is the main reason I'm raising the issue here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exact Duplicates:&lt;/strong&gt; Some of the voters (to close) claimed that such proposals are exact duplicates of StackOverflow, while others claim that they are exact duplicates of TCS.SE. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The former group believed that anything in computer science which is not theoretical is programming related. In my opinion, that is plain wrong. A basic question about Turing machines is a simple counterexample.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The latter group were unable to distinguish between research-level questions and basic ones.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some discussions can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/q/682/22946&quot;&gt;Is Computer Science a duplicate of Theoretical Computer Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an extreme case, Jonik suggested: &quot;Instead of another site, how about modifying the description of the existing site to allow a little less advanced CS theory questions too.&quot; His suggestion was unwelcome, and received some down-votes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In another thread, &#xA;Joel Spolsky &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/947/873&quot;&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; that we (TCS.SE) broaden our view. His suggestion didn't go anywhere either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe that CSTheory must have a non-research-level counterpart. I ask people here to help (re)create one on Area51, and support it adequately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PS: There's always an issue of homeworks: Professors don't like their students to &lt;em&gt;cheat&lt;/em&gt; by asking homework problems in online forums.

To start with, we are happy to announce two editors-in-chief of the blog. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/204/joe-fitzsimons&quot;&gt;Joe Fitzsimons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/30/aaron-sterling&quot;&gt;Aaron Sterling&lt;/a&gt; have agreed to manage content on the blog, and among their roles will be soliciting posts from YOU to place there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the second point. As currently envisaged (Joe and Aaron will have more to say on this I'm sure), anyone who's interested can contribute to the blog, and this is how it would work:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;you write a draft on the site&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An editor reviews it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It gets posted. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Presumably as time goes on, some contributors might get direct posting rights - we can see how that goes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what should you do now ? Sign up if you're interested in contributing. To do so, post your name and/or a link to your profile, which hopefully has an email address, in an answer below, and one of the admins (Kaveh or myself) will create an account for you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once that's done, you can start writing drafts. And I'm sure the editors will nudge people as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about the format, content styles etc, please create a new meta question and link it here.

How could you modify &quot;specific axioms from paper&quot; to allow quantum computing?

The simplest example off the top of my head is the&#xA;  longest substring of ones in a 0,1 string.

Every tag you use should be able to work, more or less, as the only tag on a question.

Too much personal tone can be distracting, and reducing the personal tone can improve the readability of a question (or perhaps also an answer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular example, the question before the edit sounds a little like a diary rather than a question written as a question from the beginning.  It is fine in a blog, but it is probably suboptimal on a Q&amp;amp;A website.  I guess that this is why Kaveh felt the need for an edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in this particular example, I do not think that it was done well.  I do not like the opening after the edit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There is always a way for application in topics related to theoretical computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite the intent of the edit which Kaveh explained, this does not sound like a professional to me.  Instead, it sounds like some newbie who tries to pretend to be a professional.  Frankly speaking, the question sounded at least honest before the edit, but it sounds pretentious after the edit.  I am sorry, but I do not like how the question is stated after the edit at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it should be pointed out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300/how-to-ask-a-good-question/306#306&quot;&gt;we encourage to include a personal motivation in a question&lt;/a&gt;: we want a question which the asker cares out of his/her own interest rather than a question which the asker thinks that someone cares.  In this sense, good questions necessarily contain some personal part.  I do not think that it is right to remove everything personal from a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking this way, it seems very difficult to edit a question to reduce the personal tone while maintaining some degree of personality.  If you do it, you should do it right.  I guess that it is a perfectly reasonable choice to give up such a difficult task and just either leave the question open or close it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" LastActivityDate="2011-11-02T19:36:12.897" CommentCount="0" />

Because of this, I think that it is wiser to explain the reason when you vote down a post.  But that is a separate issue.

The scope of cstheory is research-level. Questions that are at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate students are not part of the scope. There are other Q&amp;amp;A sites which have a more general scope like &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Math.SE&lt;/a&gt; that would welcome questions from students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Votes (down and up) are one of the main ways users express their opinion about the quality of a question and how interesting it is. A user may down vote a question if she/he thinks the question is off-topic or has other problems (e.g. unclear, not answerable in its current form, argumentative, not a real question, post to solicit opinion, ...).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to know why &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8826/is-halting-that-hard-yes&quot;&gt;your question&lt;/a&gt; is down voted you can ask for that in place of attacking other users. I will explain my down vote in more detail below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that you are trying to find a way to get around the undecidability of halting problem. The halting problem (as it is defined in the literature) is undecidable and that is a mathematical theorem. Now one might be interested in decidable variations of halting problem. That is a well studied topic, and one can ask a research level question about that. There are also researchers working on these kind of problems who try to find ways to deal with undecidability in practice (mainly in formal methods community, but also in theoretical computer science). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand your question has no sign that you are familiar with the literature. I can tell that this is something a typical undergraduate student taking their first course in computability would ask. It is nice that a student would think about this kind of problems. But everything has a place and the place of this question is not cstheory. If you ask it on Math.SE you probably will not get any down votes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an analogy, it is completely fine and even encouraged that students ask questions like this in an undergraduate computability class from the instructor. Asking it in a research-level computability workshop will probably be unwelcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ask a question about halting problem and show that you are familiar with the literature and understand the basics in the area, and the question is a real question (posting a question to see how others think about your idea about how to solve halting problem is not a real question) and is clearly stated (can be answered without much back-and-forth comments where others try to guess what you want to ask, which can be a sign that the question is not well-thought), then that can be on-topic and I would guess would not receive any down votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ps:&#xA;I would suggest that you take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq#questions-should-be-based-on-knowledge-sharing-not-on-shirking&quot;&gt;this section of the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and also the pages linked there.

Winners of each round will also get 100 USD to donate to charity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the battle will work:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Participating sites are English, Math, Statistics, Theoretical Computer Science, Linguistics, Physics, Philosophy, and History.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each round will last a week, and the contest will be single-elimination bracket-style. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To move on to the next round, the average number of questions each site asks per day during the round must exceed that site’s current average. Whichever site exceeds their average by more questions wins the round. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To determine who would face off in the first round, we seeded the sites according to past activity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you ready for this?! Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/DIyMj.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few more notes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Although this is a contest, a “Battle of the Sites” if you will, it’s all in the spirit of fundraising for charity and having fun. So while we understand (and encourage!) competitiveness, try to keep it friendly. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While we expect this contest to generate a lot of new questions, we&#xA;have full faith in the community’s ability to uphold its standards&#xA;and preference for good questions. If we find that a site is getting&#xA;a lot of bad questions during the contest, it will have to be&#xA;disqualified.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Round one starts now and ends Sunday 11/20 at 11:59 pm UTC.

That is not what we want in this community, as Gilles stated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the other is the very intent of this game, namely, trying to make the users as productive as possible.  Let me quote Asaf Karagila’s comment on &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3212/battle-of-the-sites&quot;&gt;meta.math.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis in original):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To add on the above, this is exactly why I left DeviantART.

Especially communities which I actually feel a part (which as a person I can honestly say that it is a very rare and very transient feeling).  I truly hope that the SE sites do not plan on having these &quot;happy happy joy joy&quot; activities often, I'd imagine I am not the only one feeling negatively about this sort of initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I share this feeling.  I do not want cstheory.stackexchange.com to tell me to be more productive on the website.  I participate in the website to the extent that it is fun to me, not more, and it is annoying to be asked to change it in any way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually I try to ignore such an annoying request.

Since many of the questions of this nature that people post have quick answers, the chat system enables that quick back-and-forth&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Participation is 'opt-in': since the chat system isn't front and center, there's no danger that people uninterested in answering such questions might be forced to wade through pages and pages to get to the 'research-level' questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One fear that we've had in the past with allowing lower-level questions is that we'd get swamped with such questions and that things like reputation counts and question scores would get biased towards answering such questions.

But it seems that it might not be true anymore that there are questions about algorithms and distributed computing among other things. I am not saying that there is significant overlap right now (I haven't had time to go over the questions on the site) but I am now concerned about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also my discussion with Geoff (one of pro-term moderators) &lt;a href=&quot;https://scicomp.meta.stackexchange.com/a/176/207&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think we want to see another SE site covering a significant part of our scope (as crypto.se did and hit the number of crypto questions on cstheory, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tags/cr.crypto-security/topusers&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some question that I think we need to think about:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you think there is a problem about the current scope of computational sciences site? Do we need to be concerned about this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What distinguishes questions that are suitable for cstheory from those on computational sciences and vic versa on overlapping topics (like algorithms, distributed computing, ...)?

My question is about what to do in theSo, the question is, if you doubt between what to do latter case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, this what the FAQ says about flagging vs answering low-quality posts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, don't feed the trolls! Replying to abusive, off-topic, or inappropriate content only encourages it – whereas flagging allows removal without providing undue attention. &#xA;  Post related to: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1264/conventions-on-downvoting&quot;&gt;conventions on downvoting&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;  Which suggest that flagging is the best thing to do when you thing a post does not match the standards we expect. However, declined flags get a preventive remark:&#xA;  Flag declined - flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which suggests that flagging may flood moderators. Then I thought, maybe it is better that users control content by voting up/down. But whenever you vote down you see a pop-up:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Please consider adding a comment if you think this post can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, try to make constructive suggestions.

While I try to judge this proposal on its own merit, it is likely that the time and energy I have invested in CS.SE influences me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid that broadening the scope in this way would destroy the existing community. A Stack Exchange site is defined by two things: the kind of questions it accepts, and the audience it attracts. Even though each question is in principle judged on its intrinsic merits, the long-term effect is to create a community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this site, the community is centered around researchers in theoretical computer science. Participants tend to be researchers in TCS, researchers in other fields, or graduate students aspiring to become researchers. The participants who are welcomed are generally those who came with the expectation of participating in a community dominated by TCS researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not see a problem with allowing more applied questions. As long as academics and people who want to fit in with academics dominate the site, that isn't a problem. It may be difficult to bootstrap an applied CS community (it would have been a lot easier to do when the site was young), but if it works, it won't change the tone of the site, and if it fails, the site won't have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, opening the door to more basic questions means opening the door to a broader audience. This should be a carefully controlled process. In particular, I advise you not to try to draw on Stack Overflow as an audience base. A majority of Stack Overflow does not know or care what it means to be a scientist. The kind of people you would attract are those who now post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Programmers&lt;/a&gt;. If you attract those people, be prepared to moderate their content. And to moderate them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reacting to specific points in your proposal:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We now have a natural forum (cs.stackexchange.com) for the more &quot;basic&quot; algorithms questions, and the cstheory &quot;brand&quot; is well established as a 'research-only' venue. So we have an easy process to shunt questions that are obviously undergrad level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that CS.SE is not exclusively for basic questions. It is for questions at all level, ranging all the way from CS 101 homework to applied research (and even research in theory, but we suggest CSTheory.SE to the rare asker who comes with a theory question that seems to go unanswered because it is too hard).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;excluding questions from people who might be 'research-level' in a sub area but aren't experts in some other domain&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I see (I admit to not following CSTheory.SE very closely), this already happens: as long as there's a feeling that peers are talking with peers, questions tend to be appreciated, left open and answered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;creating the impression of an unfriendly site (which is a bigger problem in terms of maintaining the audience)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the community is doing an adequate job of retaining the audience it likes in and keeping the undesirables in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, while the current guidelines may be stricter than this, I think an intelligent application of the existing policies already gives you what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="634" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:48:30.257" LastActivityDate="2012-08-12T23:30:32.150" CommentCount="1" />

its key to this group. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this question is probably a little too hypothetical. in principle you could build a paper by stringing together some stackexchange answers but it would be unusual. as mod kaveh writes, each question must stand on its own separate merit and also note, few people regularly post questions here or with high frequency esp those with high rep, and there is some possibility that frequent questions are actually informally frowned on via the voting mechanisms &amp;amp; current collective voting tendencies. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the pattern is more in general that high rep users answer random newcomer questions. also, it is unlikely that you would get solid answers to all the separate (presumably nontrivial) questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;basically yes, that is part of the &lt;em&gt;raison d'etre&lt;/em&gt; of the group, to occasionally collaboratively generate scientific research to theoretical computer science in general &amp;amp; complexity theory in particular (complexity theory entries even were once highlighted here in css formatting). however the conventions around this are new &amp;amp; still being established as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1st, use the stackexchange search engine highly extensively and also the tag system, both can be very effective. find every relevant post to your paper or subject. figure out the best knowledge that is posted on the group. figure out the border between the known and unknown and what is posted vs not posted. this also requires close familiarity with nearby papers. it helps to bookmark or &quot;favorite&quot; all related posts on here &amp;amp; elsewhere. use the related posts column on the right also. mix this with heavy cross use of google. in some cases you may find an expert on here posting on the subj. you can look at their own answers &amp;amp; look at their papers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;next, try posting a single carefully crafted question totally centered on your subject and your paper and what you're thinking of establishing. its a delicate mix between the general (background) and the specific (the new result/concept you're aiming for). as if you have a single chance to ask the experts what you'd most want to know but what you also most think they'd be able to answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;responses will help you figure out what is known by the crowd but also how relevant it is to this group based on reaction in form of comments, enthusiasm, voting, etc. it has to be at a &quot;just right difficulty&quot; between too easy [not research] and too hard [you wont get replies/answers]. it takes some time to find that balance &amp;amp; its an ongoing challenge. dont assume that if there is a good answer, someone will post it. dont assume that if people post answers, those are the best possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;you will prob find if you are very focused that there are two gaps. one is the gap between what you want to establish in your paper and what is established in related literature. the other gap is what you can actually find out by using this group (both by searching it and posting questions). these two gaps are interrelated. you can judge whether you can build on all this with meaningful new results. but those key results will basically have to be generated by you, nobody else, unless you have found &lt;em&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt;

My edit was rejected, and it's not clear to me why (the message is &quot;changes too much in the original post,&quot; but it simply corrects half of a sentence). While I would welcome specifics about my edit, I don't care too much about the particular fix and I do not want to make a big deal about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly wondering for the larger picture if there is a good way to avoid this situation recurring. Some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer or more detailed and specific messages for rejected edits. The message I got looks like it was from a drop-down, and so maybe the reason did not fit nicely into a category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some system for moderators to defer to the opinion of the original author of the content that was edited, because he may be able to judge the edit more easily (being more familiar with what he wrote)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some form of edits that are &quot;unapproved&quot; but optionally visible to users (e.g. a comment shows up below the post with my name that says &quot;this is my revised version of what I think the above should say, but [moderator] believes it might change the author's intent&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize that not many edits are rejected though, so perhaps I'm in the minority here, and focus on this issue would be misplaced. I'm also not sure of the technical feasibility of any of these suggestions, and perhaps that rules some or all of them out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; In a discussion on the linked post I got some more details about the specifics of why my edit might not be preferred. Based on that it seems more likely that the problem is to do with feedback accompanying a rejected edit rather than the actual decision of whether to accept/reject (and so the first bullet would likely be the most appropriate fix).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, as one who hasn't edited or reviewed an edit I do not have a good feel for the bounds on the scope of edits; perhaps all other edits here have just been re-taggings and math-modes, and mine should have been a comment instead.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool site-related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;script packs or power tools&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

I was absolutely gung-ho about writing an answer because questions that specifically want and advanced-level survey are rare. A couple of hours later, I realised that this was never going to end. I'm glad to see that the question has now been made community wiki. I think my current answer is too long and should be split into different answers. I have three concrete proposals for answers to that question. Please let me know if you agree with these proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal 1&lt;/em&gt;. Every answer discusses a specific sub-area of computational logic and consists of three paragraphs. The first paragraph give a high-level overview of the field aimed at researchers in mathematics or TCS. The second paragraph highlights some results in the field and techniques used to prove those results. The third paragraph mentions current directions and open problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal 2&lt;/em&gt;. We make a &quot;table of contents&quot; answer that lists different sub-areas of computational logic and hyperlinks to the different answers. Anyone can add to this list, and then add a separate answer for the area mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal 3.&lt;/em&gt; If the OP agrees, we modify the original question a bit to make explicit the structure desired for answers. (We could also do this in the ToC answer I suggest in Proposal 2, but people might not read other answers before replying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel such an advanced research summary would be a valuable resource for the future reference, and that obtaining such a survey via our user base would be effective. If it works here, we could also follow a similar protocol/structure for certain other broad reference requests. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What say ye?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4155" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.560" LastActivityDate="2013-01-14T07:01:27.920" Title="Help answering the &quot;CS applications of logic&quot; question" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="2" />

However, the answers posted there are not satisfactory because they are unclear or they are not answers to the exact question being asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a good way to to ask for a clearer or better answer to an old question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following are some ways, but they have their own disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing he/she can do is to post a question nevertheless, probably stating why the existing answers are not satisfactory.  However, from answerer’s viewpoint, I think that it is better to post a new answer to the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; question or edit an answer to the old question rather than posting an answer to the new question, because it is the same question and it is just a better answer.  Therefore, I think that in this situation, the new question should be closed as a duplicate for the old question.  Now from asker’s viewpoint, it is awkward (or possibly even abusive) to post a question knowing that it will be closed as a duplicate of the old question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is to write a comment to the old question or its answer.  But if the user is new, he/she cannot post a comment.  In addition, if the user who made that post is no longer active, chances that anyone notices the comment are slim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is to edit something in the old question or propose an edit.  If the user has enough rep points, he/she can edit a post.  Add a tag or correct a typo or make some other harmless edit, and the question is bumped on the top page and it receives some attention.  Proposing an edit has one obstacle, but if the proposed edit is accepted, it has the same effect.  But either way, this sounds like an abusive or spam-like activity to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is to bring this up in chat room.  Problems are that it is usually not active, and that if the user is new, he/she cannot post a message in chat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is bounty, but this requires some rep points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.610" LastActivityDate="2013-02-11T04:39:43.540" Title="How to ask for a clearer answer to an old question" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;asking-questions&gt;&lt;exact-duplicates&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="3" />

In the case of the above question, here's what my personal (i.e non-moderator) take is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the question rambles terribly and doesn't really get to the point&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the poster has a habit of writing questions and answers like this, and frequently gets downvoted/otherwise censured for such postings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But in this case, another user has suggested a concrete improvement that can be made, and there are a number of upvotes (and faves) for the question. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the moderator role here is to help suggest modifications (especially since there appears to be a germ of substance in the question) and encourage the OP to make the changes (which I will note the OP has &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; done). As an individual, the moderator is free to downvote the post in its current form. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as a community moderator, I prefer to do nothing rather than do something, and in this case I have to ask what the consequences are of doing nothing. Either the OP will fix the post or not. If not, it's quite likely that other members of the community will downvote the post and/or vote to close it. Or they might attempt to answer the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;worst case scenario&quot; from my point of view might be that an ill-formed question sticks around for a while. But what is the downside of this ? The OP regularly posts ill-formed questions, and they get hammered (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/7884/vzn?tab=questions&amp;amp;sort=votes&quot;&gt;about 2/3 of the questions posted&lt;/a&gt; have a net negative score).

For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18372/111&quot;&gt;How are lower bounds for computational complexity proved?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18406/111&quot;&gt;Roots of a polynomial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, there is an undergraduate-level &quot;textbook&quot; answer.  (For the first question: Sorting requires $\Omega(n\log n)$ comparisons.  For the second question: Hilbert's 10th is undecidable.)  But if we look past those easy answers, these are legitimate research-level questions in theoretical computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, but then how does one prove lower bounds for problems that can't be solved by comparison trees?  Or lower bounds bigger than $\Omega(n\log n)$ for problems solvable in polynomial time?  Or exponential lower bounds for NP-hard problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, but then how does one actually find integer roots of polynomials in practice?  Are there effective algorithms for broad and interesting classes of polynomials?  Are there algorithms with provable approximation guarantees (for interesting classes of polynomials)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the deeper question is likely not what the original poster intended.

It would be nice if the moderators here would avoid migrating low-quality questions to CS.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I noticed recently a few low-quality questions that were migrated to the Computer Science Stack Exchange (CS.SE) site.  I would suggest that we avoid doing that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's a good question, and on-topic for CS.SE, I definitely encourage you to migrate to CS.SE.  For instance, if it is not research-level but would be a reasonable question, migrating to CS.SE is a great idea.  Go for it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question for CS.SE -- please don't migrate it to CS.SE.  If it's a bad question, just close it, don't migrate it.  Please don't make CS.SE a dumping ground for bad questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's a good question -- well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, don't let that stop you from migrating.  If it's just the English, we can edit it over at CS.SE.  But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear -- I personally don't think it should be migrated over to CS.SE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One recent example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038&quot;&gt;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038&lt;/a&gt;.  In my opinion, that question shouldn't have been migrated to CS.SE.  It is not a good fit for the Computer Science Stack Exchange.  The question does not show evidence of effort.  It asks a question about a topic that is already covered by reference questions at CS.SE, with no evidence that the question-asker was aware of that.  These issues are not something that those of us at CS.SE can fix through simple edits to the question.  Of course, that's just one example.  I don't mean to pick on that one or focus on that one too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kaveh explains that the CS.SE admins specifically requested that &quot;badly written&quot; questions are still OK to migrate to CS.SE.  I didn't realize that!  That explains a lot.  Perhaps that's something we should discuss.  I'm not sure whether &quot;badly written&quot; refers to the English/grammar, or to more fundamental issues (like whether it's a good question, whether it is well-researched, whether it is on-topic and focused and detailed and not a duplicate).  If the former, I agree, English/grammar problems should not be a barrier to migration.  If the latter, well, I guess I might have a slight difference of opinion with the CS.SE admins -- maybe that's something we need to discuss on CS.meta, instead of here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I certainly don't mean to imply that this is a huge, systemic problem that requires major changes to migration, and I don't mean to imply the moderators here are doing anything wrong (I think the moderators are doing a great job!).  Overall I think the process is generally working well.  I just wanted to suggest a minor refinement that I think might make things work better on CS.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1086/5038&quot;&gt;Moderators: Please be very careful when migrating questions to other Stack Exchange websites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1285/5038&quot;&gt;To migrate or not to migrate (just close)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1507/5038&quot;&gt;Migrating to cs.SE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/691/755&quot;&gt;Do we want CSTheory.SE to migrate bad questions over here?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5038" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.537" LastActivityDate="2013-09-24T05:49:29.113" Title="Please don't migrate bad questions to CS.Stack Exchange" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;migration&gt;&lt;closing&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="7" />

Also, technically, it isn't a computer science question, it's a math question that falls short of reaching a CS application. I wouldn't say that migrating it is fundamentally wrong, but it is a bit of a waste of effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If in doubt — if the question is not great but not crap either — you might as well migrate.

We have discussed previously (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1264/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1395/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) that we are not going to require or even demand people to explain their votes. When I see a down-vote that I don't understand I politely comment that I don't understand it, but I think demanding an explanation or stating that there is no reason for the down-vote goes too far. It is not an abuse if people are using their votes in a way different from us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have argued a number of times that I am against counter-voting, that is voting to null the effect of another user's vote. Everyone has their own opinion. The total reflects the opinion of the community, it is not the job of any particular user to decide what the total should be. Counter-voting encourages other users to do the same and use their votes to null votes in place of express their opinion about the question. Each vote is a manifestation of some user's opinion and if we respect their opinions then we should respect their votes even when we disagree with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it is more productive if we comment and explain why we think it is a suitable and interesting question in place of just asking others why they have down-voted the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, I see several possible reasons for a down-vote. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formating: It is using an image in place of writing the expression which I think has been one of the reasons people down-vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content: The questions seems to simply ask how to calculate some expression for some particular values. It seems to ask how to apply a method explained in a paper in a particular case in practice. It is too localized and it doesn't seem to be a &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; question in &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; computer science. It is also unclear what is the trouble the OP is facing in calculating the expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ask me I think we are being too open right now (I guess it is partly because people get bored that there are not as many questions as they would like) to questions which should not be here and are more suitable for CS.SE.

I'd certainly hope our moderators would be glad to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In more detail: I agree with you.

I personally don't think the current behavior is the best solution to that problem, but whatever: it's clear that the site developers have a different view, that they have thought about this, they do have reasons for the current behavior, and ultimately, this is unlikely to change (at least, not in the foreseeable future).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For now, no changes seem likely to come our way.&#xA;Instead, the standard workaround seems to be: if you notice that a question/answer was auto-converted to CW inappropriately, flag it for a moderator (flag as &quot;needs moderator attention&quot;), and ask the moderator to please reverse the community wiki status.  Moderators have that ability.  Apparently, many moderators have stated that they do routinely grant these requests (absent concrete reasons not to), and it is considered legitimate to ask the moderators to do so.  See, e.g.,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/179756/160917&quot;&gt;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/179756/160917&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/192784/160917&quot;&gt;What criteria are taken into account when deciding to undo Community Wiki status on answers?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/192438/160917&quot;&gt;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/192438/160917&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/83373/160917&quot;&gt;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/83373/160917&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/179825/160917&quot;&gt;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/179825/160917&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you'll still lose any rep that was accumulated between when the answer was auto-converted to CW and when the moderator reverts the CW status.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My proposal:&lt;/strong&gt; Our moderators should routinely and gladly grant such flag requests, as long as there has not been any signs of abuse.  We should be grateful to anyone who takes the time to improve their questions or answers, as long as they're not abusing the feature to try to bump their question/answer to the front page.  I don't think our moderators should refuse to grant such flags (e.g., on the basis that they're going to wait for this behavior to be changed -- as it's pretty clear this behavior is not going to be changed any time soon).

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool site-related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;script packs or power tools&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

This website allows me to keep my finger on the pulse of other subfields and see what sort of questions are interesting others and how they think about certain problems. As such, I think cstheory is primarily a great way to bring the community together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, my hope is to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2013/09/15/algorithmic-lens/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;algorithmic lens&lt;/a&gt; as a viewpoint on other sciences and I hope others do so as well. If non-computer scientists start using tools from cstheory then this website (and its placement among other science and math websites in the SE network) could provide a great way for us to engage with them, and share our knowledge while figuring out what problems they want to use our tools to address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would address the specific flags through comments, discuss with the other moderators, and if the behavior persists contact the user over chat. If direct communication with the user does not resolve the issue then I would consider a suspension for some amount of time and contact over email (if such means are available).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would contact the mod in private. If after a discussion we are still unsure of the decision then I would raise the question in meta for input from the community. However, I doubt this would come up since in my experience so far I have not seen closed questions for which I disagreed with closing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my answer to the first question, I described my views for this site in cstheory and the larger scientific community. I think we are already moving toward this organically, but it might help to show more clearly why cstheory is a worthwhile part of a researcher's workflow by generating more answers to lists like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/784/1037&quot;&gt;Original proofs generated on the parent site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1257/1037&quot;&gt;References to cstheory in the literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to judge questions by their own merit. The only time I would let my knowledge of the users previous activity affect my decision is if I am unsure about the questions. However, in these cases of being unsure, I will never act before the community voices their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a special case of questions that accidentally capture a deeper issue, and are simple when read at a surface level but significant at a deeper level. In this case, I think it is important to engage with the user through comments to see if this deeper exploration will serve the user, or if they were just looking for the easy answer. This is often a judgement of the users &quot;mathematical maturity&quot;. If they were not looking for a deeper discussion, and the question is fine otherwise, I would consider migration to CS.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators should interfere as little as possible with community self-governance, and act decisively only in clear cut cases where the community guidelines are already set. Moderators should also act as unbiased intermediaries in case of heated discussions and encourage good behavior by example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will not change how I ask or answer questions. However, I will actively take note to make sure my comments are always unbiased, constructive, and within community norms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only differences I know is the binding vote and diamond (I guess there are also some drastic actions like suspension, but I will hopefully never have to use those). As someone that spends an unreasonable amount of time on the internet, the binding vote will allow me to act decisively and quickly in clear cut cases. Since &quot;close&quot; now means &quot;on hold&quot;, this will hopefully improve questions. The diamond will allow me to set a good example in my actions on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage use of our third space (i.e. the chat room) to avoid some of the chatty discussions. However, otherwise I would leave the decision on this policy to more experienced moderators or the community (maybe we should raise a meta discussion on this?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my first answer, I see helping researchers with their research as only part of the goals of this site. I think it is also a way to communicate with other disciplines, and a way to build community. Further, it is a way for future researchers to keep an idea of what the community is interested in, and learn from reading others questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes? E.g. users who are not researchers in theoretical computer science or any related field and insist on posting questions/answers/comments that are off-topic by the site's policies, e.g. cranks that want to use the site to verify or draw attention to their attempts on famous open problems?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We already have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/274/1037&quot;&gt;policy on crank-friendly preprints and topics&lt;/a&gt;, I will enforce this policy. I don't think we have gotten too many problems with cranky users, especially compared to other SE sites. We have a great community that already deals with this well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How can we make sure the site will not be overridden by users who are not researchers so cstheory does not suffer the faith of other online open resources for researchers like Usenet groups?

However, I do agree that the reputation mechanism on the site is broken and it is easy for a persistent user to accumulate reputation.

what an astonishing deep mystery, almost like a TCS analog of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt;! and not the only apparent deep parallel between &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/89802/33566&quot;&gt;TCS &amp;amp; physics&lt;/a&gt;. and still basically open after more than ½-century. truly this field is full of the Everest of problems. &lt;em&gt;many or even most in pristine pre-summited state!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in college, learned/experimented/sought &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/14811/what-is-the-enlightenment-im-supposed-to-attain-after-studying-finite-automata&quot;&gt;FSM-enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; in an intriguing &lt;a href=&quot;http://vzn1.wordpress.com/code/collatz-conjecture-experiments/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;research-oriented attack&lt;/a&gt; on one mountain. climbed to a local minimum! also started experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/6588/reducing-the-integer-factorization-problem-to-an-np-complete-problem/6605#6605&quot;&gt;SAT &amp;amp; factoring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;there are many signs computer science is entering or in the middle of a (very long-range?) &lt;a href=&quot;http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/2/160156-the-explosive-growth-of-postdocs-in-computer-science/fulltext&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;golden age&lt;/a&gt;, and thats motivating, energizing, even at times &lt;a href=&quot;http://vzn1.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/dwave-and-the-inception-of-the-qm-computing-dream/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;exciting&lt;/a&gt;. its a field-in-motion. cutting edge and an awesome, buzzing-crackling fusion of abstract theory and real-life application. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;so, a dream job for me would be high-paying TCS research/applications and have come close to that fantasy in real life over the years. but, later, after working 4 yrs in scientific laboratory alongside graduate students and Phds, realized that combination of terms might be verging mostly on an oxymoron; ie it seemed that scientific researchers (not just those in TCS) didnt seem to be (how to put this delicately) reknowned for their salaries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;am proud to be a contributing part of a rare, unique group that captures some of this energy/momentum/dynamism esp in the way that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19759/core-algorithms-deployed&quot;&gt;connects with applications&lt;/a&gt;. &#xA;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/application-of-theory&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;application-of-theory&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;application-of-theory&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite conceptual fusion/paradigm/site tag.) by some very hard work by many dedicated, farsighted, brilliant individuals, cstheory stackexchange is a really superb forum and by far the best venue on the entire cyberspace for that right now, and probably will be for years into the future. it mixes top achievers from academia with the wild open internet (another great/shearing &lt;em&gt;fusion&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TCS is also in the midst and at the forefront of massive/pivotal decade-long shifts and transformations. eg quantum computing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0691148902&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;electronic publishing/open science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/4768/references-on-collective-intelligence-with-respect-to-cs-applications&quot;&gt;collaborative filtering, collective wisdom, collective intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and amazingly the stackexchange site captures various key elements of all that.&#xA;am especially interested in &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vzn1.wordpress.com/volunteer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;cyber collaboration&lt;/a&gt; possibilities seen in the groundbreaking &lt;a href=&quot;http://polymathprojects.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;polymath&lt;/a&gt; model, which is at heart in its radical/dramatic successes not that different than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simonsfoundation.org/mathematics-and-physical-science/the-global-math-commons/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;stackexchange system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;what is [great] TCS?

They provide very limited markup options, they're not searchable (using the internal SE search; Google and other external search engines do index &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of them), and they're subject to deletion at any time for any or no reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that, once the question has been solved through discussion in the comments, the solution should be written up as an answer (or incorporated into an existing answer), crediting the contributors to the discussion as needed. At that point, the &quot;scratchpad&quot; comments are no longer needed, and may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, it doesn't always work that way in practice, but that's the way it's designed to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing you can do, to try and get a little closer to the ideal, is to occasionally go over your old answers and see if any of them have comments (written by you or someone else) that add value to the answer. If you spot any, edit the answer to incorporate the information directly into it (with appropriate credit, as needed). This ensures that, even if the comments are later deleted, the useful information in them will not be lost. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also go over your old comments (available in your user profile, under &quot;activity&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;comments&quot;) and see if any of them might be usefully turned into edits or stand-alone answers.  Also, if any questions you've asked have been effectively answered via comments, you can either summarize the conclusions into a self-answer (again, with appropriate credit, of course) or just ask the user who posted the most useful comment(s) to turn them into an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, once the comments have been turned or edited into answers, you may also want to delete them (if they're yours) or flag them as obsolete (if not) immediately.

When crossposting please summarize the relevant discussions from other sites in your question and link between the copies in both directions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sure sounds like cross-posting after a delay is allowed.  On the other hand, when you click on the link to the &quot;site policy&quot;, the policy described at the link target actually only mentions MathOverflow, not other SE sites.  (I hadn't noticed this previously, because I don't have enough reputation to vote to close.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CS.SE does not seem to have any special policy about this, and I can't find any discussion of this on Meta.CS.SE.  Therefore, I would assume that CS.SE abides by the standard StackExchange policy, by default.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, given the standard StackExchange policy and the impact on both sites, I would guess that probably cross-posting on two SE sites should only be allowed if both sites opt into a policy of allowing cross-posting.  CS.SE does not seem to have opted to allow cross-posting on CS.SE+TCS.SE, and since I can't find any clear evidence that TCS.SE has, either.

This makes it impossible for people who have the same question to find the old question by searching on the old site.  To find it, they'd have to either search on Google or search on the new site.  So, if the question was squarely within scope on the old site, this makes it harder to find the information.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means there are some pros and cons either way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weighing the pros and cons, I'd suggest we stick with the default StackExchange policy and prohibit cross-posting on CS.SE and TCS.SE (cross-posting shouldn't be allowed, not even if you wait a week or two for an answer and get nothing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5038" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:29:37.593" LastActivityDate="2014-07-01T16:03:33.137" CommentCount="4" />

It seems like it would be a good experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tricky bit is to select the criteria for which questions would be shown.  I can see two plausible possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative 1: Have a set of tags which are eligible for this, e.g., algorithms, complexity-theory, computability, undecidability, etc.  Any question with vote total of 10+ and with at least one tag in the whitelist would then be eligible to be shown on CSTheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might whittle down the list of questions to those that are related to theoretical computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it has the problem that many of the questions selected in this way will not be research-level.  There are a lot of questions on CS.SE with 10+ votes that are not research-level questions in theoretical computer science, and they might be unwelcome on CSTheory.  Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes&quot;&gt;top questions on CS.SE&lt;/a&gt; sorted by vote total, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/complexity-theory?sort=votes&amp;amp;pageSize=50&quot;&gt;top questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see what I mean.  Only a small fraction of the highest-voted questions there would be a good fit for CSTheory; the majority would not be useful to display on CSTheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I looked at the top 50 highest-voted questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag.  All of them have a vote total of 10 or higher.  By my own highly personal assessment, about 10 of them look like they would be good to display on the CSTheory.SE front page.  The others don't look like great candidates (they are elementary, of narrow interest, or were about proving NP-hardness of a specific problem and the question has already been solved).  A 20% hit rate isn't great.  But this is my own personal taste, and others may differ.  I encourage readers to do their own count, see what they get, and post their own evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative 2: Allow moderators to select which questions are eligible for display in this way.  This could be indicated, for instance, via a moderator-only tag that's added to the question on CS.SE, which triggers it to be shown on CSTheory -- analogous to the &quot;featured&quot; tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would require some manual effort from moderators, but allows more control over which questions are displayed, and enables selecting questions which are research-level and which relate to theoretical computer science.  (A minor difficulty with using a special tag is that, if the question already has 5 tags, it may not be possible to add a 6th tag.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5038" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:48:30.257" LastActivityDate="2014-09-12T00:50:54.580" CommentCount="3" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool site-related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

I proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261196/1438&quot;&gt;some criteria&lt;/a&gt; last summer (which we've been using internally for a while). My evaluation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanity check: Yes, there are plenty of reasons a question might be asked here that really belongs on the more general CS site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gather statistics: In the past 90 days, there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/posts/migrated/stats&quot;&gt;6 migrations to and from CS Theory&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cs.stackexchange.com          =&amp;gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 4 (25% rejected)&#xA;datascience.stackexchange.com =&amp;gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 1&#xA;cstheory.stackexchange.com    =&amp;gt; cs.stackexchange.com × 1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is underwhelming. It seems that in practice, people are pretty good about posting to CS when they have a non-research-level question. Just one question has been migrated away. It does not seem as if the moderators are being overwhelmed with migration flags. It's also instructive that there are few migrations the other direction. (A 25% rejection rate would be a red flag if it were not just one question.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I don't see a lot of evidence that this path is needed. Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/question-close-stats?daterange=last90days&quot;&gt;close statistics&lt;/a&gt; it seems that the custom close reason that directs people to post to CS on their own is the prefered solution. 115 questions have been closed that way over the same time period. Now if the proportion &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; shift toward migration and if those migrations are successful as a rule, we might have a reason to add this default path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16884" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.610" LastActivityDate="2015-12-23T01:32:29.217" CommentCount="6" />

As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool site-related open source apps&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question must always be tagged with the magic &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/community-ads&quot; class=&quot;post-tag moderator-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;community-ads&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;community-ads&lt;/a&gt; tag.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

Thank you to Bjørn Kjos-Hanssen for having stood up as a candidate in this session. However, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2989/2017-moderator-election-we-need-more-candidates&quot;&gt;explained previously&lt;/a&gt;, in order for an election to proceed to voting phases it is required that there is at least one more candidate than there are spaces remaining in the election. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is important for a variety of reasons. The first is that it allows the election process to proceed in a way that allows candidates to be evaluated before being elected. It also serves to indicate that there are enough people in the community who are willing to handle the responsibilities of overseeing moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Theoretical Computer Science is not a site that's particularly in danger of low moderation. There's a healthy number of regular users across most reputation brackets who remain active on the site, still handling general moderation tasks.  The flag load itself isn't particularly large, and the current moderation team has expressed that they aren't overwhelmed by it. However, only one of the current moderators is highly active - while this is sufficient for the current flag load, it is healthier for the site to have multiple active moderators, not only to split even the small loads but also to handle situations where one of the moderators may have more pressing matters to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be that now is just not a good time to have hosted an election for this site.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question must always be tagged with the magic &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/community-ads&quot; class=&quot;post-tag moderator-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;community-ads&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;community-ads&lt;/a&gt; tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2993&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6115" LastActivityDate="2018-01-30T19:26:27.193" Title="Community Promotion Ads - 2018" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-ads&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="0" FavoriteCount="1" ClosedDate="2019-02-07T13:27:21.267" />

What approach will you take?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that an author is entitled to choose for themselves whether to keep or delete their comments as long as they are relevant and respectful.  As a result, I will only delete comments in extreme situations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;I have a bit the impression that part of the reason why the &quot;inactivity&quot; of the moderators came to the attention of SE was the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/38803/is-norbert-blums-2017-proof-that-p-ne-np-correct&quot;&gt;Is Norbert Blum&amp;#39;s 2017 proof that $P \ne NP$ correct?&lt;/a&gt; which attracted some inappropriate content and corresponding flags. Those flags stayed around for a long time before they were handled. But apart from that episode, I never had the impression that cstheory.se would need more active moderators, the community self-moderation felt sufficient. Should moderators stay inactive as long as the self-moderation of the community works well?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel that moderators should never be inactive.  They should always be active members who contribute to the community and regularly read recent questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, I also feel that moderators should only use their special privileges when it's necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would first identify whether (1) the comments are inappropriate, (2) the flags are inappropriate, or (3) users are being inappropriate towards each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When something looks clearly inappropriate, I would honestly explain why the comment or flag was inappropriate either directly or via comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the situation, I would either:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Leave it closed and trust the other moderator's judgement&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) Reopen it and include a note for why it was reopened&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) Contact the other moderator directly to resolve the issue&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that moderators should do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Flag, Tag, Edit, Review, Resolve Issues&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) When necessary, get involved with community engagement promoting positive behavior on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

A few of them include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Top banner is shorter in height, so some artwork has to be adjusted along with some logos.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Left Navigation is active everywhere (but can be collapsed into a menu by visiting your site preferences - &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/311237/284336&quot;&gt;instructions here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Responsive layout is active, which lets the site adjust as browser widths change - no side scrolling (some pages haven't been updated, yet, though). For now, if you prefer the scrolling, you can disable this by clicking the &quot;disable responsiveness&quot; link in the footer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many site elements including tags and voting arrows are standardized across the network.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Link underlining is active. In an effort to make links more visible, they are now being underlined.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have concerns or issues regarding the left nav or the overall approach we are taking to theming, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310908/live-left-nav-new-theming-and-responsiveness&quot;&gt;this Meta Stack Exchange post&lt;/a&gt; is the right place for feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, there are some unique design elements like voting arrows and tags that are being standardized in this process. Keeping these custom elements makes our ability to maintain the sites too complex and, while we're very sad to see them go, we're in a difficult position of needing to make the site designs work together so that we can continue to address feature requests and bugs that will make your Q&amp;amp;A experience better.

And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of &lt;strong&gt;Community Promotion Ads&lt;/strong&gt;! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it.

Sasho raised one question and one answer on his first comment: he was not sure why a particular part of some paper is correct and he was thinking that paper answers the question. Then I spent time to look at that paper and first I explained why that part is correct then asked why Sasho thinks that answers the question. Then Sasho understand his mistake and I don't know why, he or someone else removed his comment and then he answered me. Then I just upvoted his comment to say I'm agree with you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I looked back at the question, I've noticed my comment has been removed. I think I didn't do that, unless unexpectedly I pressed the delete button. I'm wondering why someone should flag that comment or remove it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally do not delete my own comments when someone provides a constructive answer to me, because, that answer might be helpful for others in the future. However, even if someone removes his own comment why should a constructive answer to that comment be deleted? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the aforementioned case, even if after deletion of the first comment, someone doesn't understand what I'm answering, could ask it in a new comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1846" LastActivityDate="2019-06-10T16:57:40.540" Title="Suspicious deletion of a comment" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;support&gt;&lt;comments&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" />

I have also received my computer science bachelor degree from the same institute and university. My research area is mainly on Distributed Systems. More specifically in designs of Middleware platforms for Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing. Aside from Distributed Systems, I am also interested on Operating Systems, Computer Architecture and Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the philosophical side, I am an enthusiast of the free software movement. I think that there is enormous potential in collaboration. This potential, makes me interested in developing and contributing to free software projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the tech point of view, I am interested in:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Java:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Middleware implementations (RMI, JMS, others);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Virtual Machines internals;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Desktop, Web frameworks and Sensors!

I also have experience with technologies including XNA/MonoGame, Unity, Ruby on Rails, FRC/FTC robotics libraries (WPILib and the FTC SDK), as well as the afore-mentioned OpenGL and some mobile development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I currently attend high school in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WardBenjamin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;: WardBenjamin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheProgramm3r&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: TheProgramm3r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://benjaminward.herokuapp.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;: Benjamin Ward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" Views="2" UpVotes="0" DownVotes="0" ProfileImageUrl="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iIz8r.png?s=128&amp;g=1" AccountId="2601267" />

I personally enjoy code golf because it's basically one large test case for a language I make. After all, I believe a language is only as good as it can be short. (Thus Java often falls out of favor with me...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I heavily enjoy obfuscation. It's an expression of the mastery that one has in a language, and an art form in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I'm not coding, I'm probably playing video games (TF2 is love, TF2 is life), writing, reading, or (&lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;) socializing within what semblance of a social life I have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, I'm a Christian teenager, proud to be serving my God. I do what I can to let people know there is a God who loves them, without stepping on people's toes. I'm not shy about my faith, though I try not to flaunt it or greet people with a &quot;HeyhowareyoudoyouknowJesus???/??&quot;, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If, for whatever reason, you have read this far and, for whatever reason, wish to contact me, shoot me an email at &lt;a href=&quot;http://v.ht/JLink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://v.ht/JLink&lt;/a&gt; (follow the rabbit trail).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" Views="0" UpVotes="0" DownVotes="0" ProfileImageUrl="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AYhjTWVrGTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAN0/u_1BqARfLDg/photo.jpg?sz=128" AccountId="5141892" />

What you're referring to as calculus, is in fact, real analysis, or as I've recently taken to calling it, &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\left( \mathbf R,\, +,\, \times,\, \leqslant,\, \left| \cdot \right|,\, \tau \,=\, \left\{ A \,\subset\, \mathbf R \mid \forall x\,\in\, A,\, \exists \varepsilon \,&amp;gt;\, 0,\, \left] x \,-\, \varepsilon,\, x \,+\, \varepsilon\right[ \,\subset\, A \right\},\, \bigcap_{\begin{array}{c} A \,\sigma \text{-algebra of}\, \mathbf R \\ \tau \,\subset\, A \end{array}} A,\, \ell \right)$&lt;/span&gt;-analysis. Calculus is not a branch of mathematics unto itself, but rather another application of a fully functioning analysis made useful by topology, measure theory and vital &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$\mathbf R$&lt;/span&gt;-related properties comprising a full number field as defined by pure mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many mathematics students and professors use applications of real analysis every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the application of real analysis which is widely used today is often called &quot;Calculus&quot;, and many of its users are not aware that it is merely a part of real analysis, developed by the Nicolas Bourbaki group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There really is a calculus, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the field they use. Calculus is the computation process: the set of rules and formulae that allow the mathematical mind to derive numerical formulae from other numerical formulae. The computation process is an essential part of a branch of mathematics, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete number field. Calculus is normally used in combination with the real number field, its topology and its measured space: the whole system is basically real numbers with analytical methods and properties added, or real analysis. All the so-called calculus problems are really problems of real analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" Views="0" UpVotes="0" DownVotes="0" ProfileImageUrl="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aCQyz.png?s=128&amp;g=1" AccountId="8489214" />

I work for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grantstreet.com/careers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Grant Street Group&lt;/a&gt;, who are always looking to &lt;strong&gt;hire more Perl programmers&lt;/strong&gt;. I can (sometimes) be reached via email at &amp;lt;tchrist@perl.com&amp;gt;, but that address is heavily spam-filtered so just because you sent me something doesn’t guarantee that I’ll’ve read it. I’ve lived in Colorado for the last quarter century, but have previously lived abroad in Spain and England. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Colorado mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing Unix and C programming since the early 1980s. My programming interests include high-level languages, Unicode, regexes, and operating systems. My old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/407&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;O’Reilly bio&lt;/a&gt; from ages ago mutters various ancient things about me, and some folks have gone and put up &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;a silly Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; about me, too. As a kid I lived down the street from &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise_pr.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gary Gygax&lt;/a&gt; of Dungeons and Dragons fame, and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science, plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I’ve studied Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and German, along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The maxim that &lt;em&gt;“If you haven’t lost track of how many languages you’ve learned, you haven’t learned enough of them yet”&lt;/em&gt; applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" Views="0" UpVotes="0" DownVotes="0" ProfileImageUrl="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jSlyx.gif?s=128&amp;g=1" AccountId="216196" />
